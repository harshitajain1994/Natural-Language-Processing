1	From fairest creatures we desire increase,	s
2	With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:	s
3	His tender heir might bear his memory:	s
4	But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	s
5	Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	s
6	Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	s
7	Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	s
8	And only herald to the gaudy spring,	s
9	Within thine own bud buriest thy content	s
10	And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	s
11	Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	s
12	To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	s
13	When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,	s
14	Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,	s
15	Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,	s
16	Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:	s
17	Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,	s
18	Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,	s
19	To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,	s
20	Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.	s
21	If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine	s
22	Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'	s
23	Proving his beauty by succession thine!	s
24	This were to be new made when thou art old,	s
25	Now is the time that face should form another;	s
26	Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,	s
27	Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.	s
28	For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb	s
29	Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?	s
30	Or who is he so fond will be the tomb	s
31	Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee	s
32	Calls back the lovely April of her prime:	s
33	So thou through windows of thine age shall see	s
34	Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.	s
35	But if thou live, remember'd not to be,	s
36	Die single, and thine image dies with thee.	s
37	Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend	s
38	Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:	s
39	Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,	s
40	And being frank she lends to those are free.	s
41	The bounteous largess given thee to give?	s
42	Profitless usurer, why dost thou use	s
43	So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?	s
44	For having traffic with thyself alone,	s
45	Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.	s
46	Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,	s
47	What acceptable audit canst thou leave?	s
48	Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,	s
49	Which, used, lives th' executor to be.	s
50	Those hours, that with gentle work did frame	s
51	The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,	s
52	Will play the tyrants to the very same	s
53	And that unfair which fairly doth excel:	s
54	For never-resting time leads summer on	s
55	To hideous winter and confounds him there;	s
56	Sap check'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,	s
57	Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:	s
58	Then, were not summer's distillation left,	s
59	Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:	s
60	But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,	s
61	Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.	s
62	Then let not winter's ragged hand deface	s
63	In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:	s
64	Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place	s
65	With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.	s
66	That use is not forbidden usury,	s
67	Which happies those that pay the willing loan;	s
68	Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;	s
69	Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,	s
70	If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:	s
71	Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,	s
72	Leaving thee living in posterity?	s
73	Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair	s
74	Lo! in the orient when the gracious light	s
75	Lifts up his burning head, each under eye	s
76	Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,	s
77	Serving with looks his sacred majesty;	s
78	And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,	s
79	Resembling strong youth in his middle age,	s
80	Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,	s
81	Attending on his golden pilgrimage;	s
82	But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,	s
83	Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,	s
84	The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are	s
85	From his low tract and look another way:	s
86	So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,	s
87	Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.	s
88	Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?	s
89	Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.	s
90	Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,	s
91	That is so proud thy service to despise,	s
92	Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest	s
93	By unions married, do offend thine ear,	s
94	They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds	s
95	In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.	s
96	Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,	s
97	Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,	s
98	Resembling sire and child and happy mother	s
99	Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:	s
100	Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,	s
101	Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'	s
102	Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye	s
103	That thou consumest thyself in single life?	s
104	Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.	s
105	The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;	s
106	The world will be thy widow and still weep	s
107	That thou no form of thee hast left behind,	s
108	When every private widow well may keep	s
109	By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.	s
110	Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend	s
111	Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;	s
112	But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,	s
113	And kept unused, the user so destroys it.	s
114	No love toward others in that bosom sits	s
115	That on himself such murderous shame commits.	s
116	For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,	s
117	And so the general of hot desire	s
118	Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,	s
119	But that thou none lovest is most evident;	s
120	For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate	s
121	That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.	s
122	Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	s
123	Which to repair should be thy chief desire.	s
124	'I hate' from hate away she threw,	s
125	Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	s
126	Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,	s
127	Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:	s
128	That beauty still may live in thine or thee.	s
129	As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest	s
130	In one of thine, from that which thou departest;	s
131	Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.	s
132	Without this, folly, age and cold decay:	s
133	If all were minded so, the times should cease	s
134	And threescore year would make the world away.	s
135	Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,	s
136	Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:	s
137	She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby	s
138	Those lips that Love's own hand did make	s
139	When I do count the clock that tells the time,	s
140	And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;	s
141	When I behold the violet past prime,	s
142	When lofty trees I see barren of leaves	s
143	Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,	s
144	And summer's green all girded up in sheaves	s
145	Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,	s
146	Then of thy beauty do I question make,	s
147	That thou among the wastes of time must go,	s
148	Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake	s
149	And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence	s
150	Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.	s
151	O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are	s
152	No longer yours than you yourself here live:	s
153	Against this coming end you should prepare,	s
154	And your sweet semblance to some other give.	s
155	Find no determination: then you were	s
156	Yourself again after yourself's decease,	s
157	Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,	s
158	Which husbandry in honour might uphold	s
159	Against the stormy gusts of winter's day	s
160	And barren rage of death's eternal cold?	s
161	O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know	s
162	You had a father: let your son say so.	s
163	Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;	s
164	And yet methinks I have astronomy,	s
165	But not to tell of good or evil luck,	s
166	Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;	s
167	Making a famine where abundance lies,	s
168	Or say with princes if it shall go well,	s
169	By oft predict that I in heaven find:	s
170	But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,	s
171	And, constant stars, in them I read such art	s
172	If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;	s
173	Or else of thee this I prognosticate:	s
174	Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.	s
175	The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;	s
176	That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	s
177	Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;	s
178	Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky,	s
179	Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,	s
180	And wear their brave state out of memory;	s
181	Then the conceit of this inconstant stay	s
182	Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,	s
183	Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,	s
184	To change your day of youth to sullied night;	s
185	And all in war with Time for love of you,	s
186	But wherefore do not you a mightier way	s
187	Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?	s
188	And fortify yourself in your decay	s
189	With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	s
190	Now stand you on the top of happy hours,	s
191	Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	s
192	So should the lines of life that life repair,	s
193	Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,	s
194	No marvel then, though I mistake my view;	s
195	Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.	s
196	To give away yourself keeps yourself still,	s
197	And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.	s
198	Who will believe my verse in time to come,	s
199	Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb	s
200	Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.	s
201	If I could write the beauty of your eyes	s
202	And in fresh numbers number all your graces,	s
203	The age to come would say 'This poet lies:	s
204	Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'	s
205	So should my papers yellow'd with their age	s
206	Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,	s
207	And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	s
208	But were some child of yours alive that time,	s
209	Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?	s
210	Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	s
211	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	s
212	And summer's lease hath all too short a date:	s
213	Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	s
214	And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	s
215	And every fair from fair sometime declines,	s
216	By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	s
217	But thy eternal summer shall not fade	s
218	And let that pine to aggravate thy store;	s
219	Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	s
220	When in eternal lines to time thou growest:	s
221	So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	s
222	So long lives this and this gives life to thee.	s
223	Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,	s
224	And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;	s
225	Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,	s
226	And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;	s
227	Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,	s
228	And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,	s
229	To the wide world and all her fading sweets;	s
230	But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:	s
231	O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,	s
232	Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;	s
233	Him in thy course untainted do allow	s
234	For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.	s
235	Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,	s
236	My love shall in my verse ever live young.	s
237	A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted	s
238	Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;	s
239	A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted	s
240	With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;	s
241	An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,	s
242	Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;	s
243	A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,	s
244	Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.	s
245	And for a woman wert thou first created;	s
246	Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,	s
247	And by addition me of thee defeated,	s
248	By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.	s
249	But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,	s
250	Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.	s
251	So is it not with me as with that Muse	s
252	Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,	s
253	Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	s
254	And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	s
255	Making a couplement of proud compare,	s
256	With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,	s
257	With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare	s
258	O' let me, true in love, but truly write,	s
259	And then believe me, my love is as fair	s
260	To make me give the lie to my true sight,	s
261	As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:	s
262	Let them say more than like of hearsay well;	s
263	I will not praise that purpose not to sell.	s
264	My glass shall not persuade me I am old,	s
265	So long as youth and thou are of one date;	s
266	But when in thee time's furrows I behold,	s
267	Then look I death my days should expiate.	s
268	For all that beauty that doth cover thee	s
269	Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,	s
270	Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:	s
271	How can I then be elder than thou art?	s
272	O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary	s
273	As I, not for myself, but for thee will;	s
274	Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary	s
275	As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	s
276	Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;	s
277	Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.	s
278	As an unperfect actor on the stage	s
279	And taught it thus anew to greet:	s
280	Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	s
281	Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.	s
282	So I, for fear of trust, forget to say	s
283	The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	s
284	And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,	s
285	O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.	s
286	O, let my books be then the eloquence	s
287	And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	s
288	More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.	s
289	O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:	s
290	When I break twenty? I am perjured most;	s
291	Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	s
292	Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;	s
293	My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	s
294	And perspective it is the painter's art.	s
295	For through the painter must you see his skill,	s
296	To find where your true image pictured lies;	s
297	Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	s
298	But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;	s
299	Past cure I am, now reason is past care,	s
300	Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me	s
301	Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;	s
302	Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;	s
303	They draw but what they see, know not the heart.	s
304	Let those who are in favour with their stars	s
305	Of public honour and proud titles boast,	s
306	Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,	s
307	Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.	s
308	Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread	s
309	But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	s
310	And in themselves their pride lies buried,	s
311	The painful warrior famoused for fight,	s
312	Is from the book of honour razed quite,	s
313	And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:	s
314	Then happy I, that love and am beloved	s
315	Where I may not remove nor be removed.	s
316	Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage	s
317	Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,	s
318	To witness duty, not to show my wit:	s
319	Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	s
320	May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,	s
321	But that I hope some good conceit of thine	s
322	In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;	s
323	Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	s
324	Points on me graciously with fair aspect	s
325	And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,	s
326	To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:	s
327	Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;	s
328	Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.	s
329	Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,	s
330	The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;	s
331	But then begins a journey in my head,	s
332	To work my mind, when body's work's expired:	s
333	For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,	s
334	And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,	s
335	Looking on darkness which the blind do see	s
336	Save that my soul's imaginary sight	s
337	Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,	s
338	Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,	s
339	Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.	s
340	Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,	s
341	For thee and for myself no quiet find.	s
342	And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,	s
343	That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?	s
344	But found no cure: the bath for my help lies	s
345	But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?	s
346	Do in consent shake hands to torture me;	s
347	The one by toil, the other to complain	s
348	How far I toil, still farther off from thee.	s
349	I tell the day, to please them thou art bright	s
350	Till my bad angel fire my good one out.	s
351	So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,	s
352	When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.	s
353	Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse	s
354	And night doth nightly make grief's strength	s
355	When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,	s
356	I all alone beweep my outcast state	s
357	And look upon myself and curse my fate,	s
358	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	s
359	Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,	s
360	Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,	s
361	With what I most enjoy contented least;	s
362	Haply I think on thee, and then my state,	s
363	Like to the lark at break of day arising	s
364	That then I scorn to change my state with kings.	s
365	When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	s
366	I summon up remembrance of things past,	s
367	I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,	s
368	And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:	s
369	For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,	s
370	And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,	s
371	And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:	s
372	Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,	s
373	And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	s
374	The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	s
375	O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,	s
376	All losses are restored and sorrows end.	s
377	Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	s
378	And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,	s
379	And all those friends which I thought buried.	s
380	How many a holy and obsequious tear	s
381	Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye	s
382	As interest of the dead, which now appear	s
383	But things removed that hidden in thee lie!	s
384	Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,	s
385	Who all their parts of me to thee did give;	s
386	Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,	s
387	Their images I loved I view in thee,	s
388	And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.	s
389	If thou survive my well-contented day,	s
390	When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,	s
391	And shalt by fortune once more re-survey	s
392	These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,	s
393	Compare them with the bettering of the time,	s
394	And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,	s
395	Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,	s
396	Exceeded by the height of happier men.	s
397	O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:	s
398	'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,	s
399	A dearer birth than this his love had brought,	s
400	To march in ranks of better equipage:	s
401	How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,	s
402	Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'	s
403	Full many a glorious morning have I seen	s
404	Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,	s
405	Kissing with golden face the meadows green,	s
406	Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;	s
407	Anon permit the basest clouds to ride	s
408	And from the forlorn world his visage hide,	s
409	Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:	s
410	Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,	s
411	But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;	s
412	The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.	s
413	Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;	s
414	Revenge upon myself with present moan?	s
415	Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,	s
416	And make me travel forth without my cloak,	s
417	To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,	s
418	Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?	s
419	'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,	s
420	To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,	s
421	For no man well of such a salve can speak	s
422	The fairest votary took up that fire	s
423	Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:	s
424	The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief	s
425	To him that bears the strong offence's cross.	s
426	Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,	s
427	And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.	s
428	Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;	s
429	All men make faults, and even I in this,	s
430	Authorizing thy trespass with compare,	s
431	Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;	s
432	Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.	s
433	Thy adverse party is thy advocate--	s
434	And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:	s
435	Such civil war is in my love and hate	s
436	That I an accessary needs must be	s
437	Desire is death, which physic did except.	s
438	For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	s
439	So shall those blots that do with me remain	s
440	Without thy help by me be borne alone.	s
441	In our two loves there is but one respect,	s
442	Though in our lives a separable spite,	s
443	Which though it alter not love's sole effect,	s
444	Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.	s
445	Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,	s
446	Nor thou with public kindness honour me,	s
447	Unless thou take that honour from thy name:	s
448	And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend	s
449	As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s
450	As a decrepit father takes delight	s
451	So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,	s
452	Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.	s
453	Or any of these all, or all, or more,	s
454	Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,	s
455	I make my love engrafted to this store:	s
456	So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,	s
457	Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give	s
458	That I in thy abundance am sufficed	s
459	And by a part of all thy glory live.	s
460	When I against myself with thee partake?	s
461	This wish I have; then ten times happy me!	s
462	How can my Muse want subject to invent,	s
463	While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse	s
464	Thine own sweet argument, too excellent	s
465	For every vulgar paper to rehearse?	s
466	O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me	s
467	Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;	s
468	For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,	s
469	When thou thyself dost give invention light?	s
470	Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth	s
471	Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;	s
472	And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth	s
473	Eternal numbers to outlive long date.	s
474	If my slight Muse do please these curious days,	s
475	O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,	s
476	When thou art all the better part of me?	s
477	What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?	s
478	And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?	s
479	Even for this let us divided live,	s
480	And our dear love lose name of single one,	s
481	That by this separation I may give	s
482	That due to thee which thou deservest alone.	s
483	O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,	s
484	Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave	s
485	O, though I love what others do abhor,	s
486	And that thou teachest how to make one twain,	s
487	By praising him here who doth hence remain!	s
488	When all my best doth worship thy defect,	s
489	What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?	s
490	To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.	s
491	Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,	s
492	Then if for my love thou my love receivest,	s
493	I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;	s
494	But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest	s
495	By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.	s
496	I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,	s
497	Although thou steal thee all my poverty;	s
498	And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief	s
499	To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.	s
500	Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,	s
501	Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,	s
502	When I am sometime absent from thy heart,	s
503	Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,	s
504	For still temptation follows where thou art.	s
505	Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,	s
506	Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;	s
507	And when a woman woos, what woman's son	s
508	Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?	s
509	Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,	s
510	And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,	s
511	Who lead thee in their riot even there	s
512	Or made them swear against the thing they see;	s
513	Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,	s
514	That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,	s
515	And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;	s
516	A loss in love that touches me more nearly.	s
517	Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:	s
518	Within be fed, without be rich no more:	s
519	And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,	s
520	Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.	s
521	If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,	s
522	And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;	s
523	Both find each other, and I lose both twain,	s
524	And both for my sake lay on me this cross:	s
525	But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;	s
526	Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.	s
527	When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,	s
528	But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,	s
529	And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.	s
530	I guess one angel in another's hell:	s
531	To the clear day with thy much clearer light,	s
532	By looking on thee in the living day,	s
533	When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade	s
534	Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	s
535	All days are nights to see till I see thee,	s
536	And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.	s
537	If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,	s
538	Injurious distance should not stop my way;	s
539	For then despite of space I would be brought,	s
540	Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,	s
541	Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;	s
542	For nimble thought can jump both sea and land	s
543	As soon as think the place where he would be.	s
544	To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,	s
545	But that so much of earth and water wrought	s
546	A maid of Dian's this advantage found,	s
547	Receiving nought by elements so slow	s
548	But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.	s
549	The other two, slight air and purging fire,	s
550	Are both with thee, wherever I abide;	s
551	The first my thought, the other my desire,	s
552	These present-absent with swift motion slide.	s
553	Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?	s
554	In tender embassy of love to thee,	s
555	My life, being made of four, with two alone	s
556	Until life's composition be recured	s
557	By those swift messengers return'd from thee,	s
558	Who even but now come back again, assured	s
559	Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:	s
560	This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,	s
561	I send them back again and straight grow sad.	s
562	Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war	s
563	How to divide the conquest of thy sight;	s
564	Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,	s
565	My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.	s
566	My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--	s
567	A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--	s
568	But the defendant doth that plea deny	s
569	And says in him thy fair appearance lies.	s
570	To 'cide this title is impanneled	s
571	The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:	s
572	As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,	s
573	And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.	s
574	Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,	s
575	And each doth good turns now unto the other:	s
576	When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,	s
577	Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,	s
578	With my love's picture then my eye doth feast	s
579	And to the painted banquet bids my heart;	s
580	Another time mine eye is my heart's guest	s
581	And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:	s
582	So, either by thy picture or my love,	s
583	For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,	s
584	And I am still with them and they with thee;	s
585	Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight	s
586	Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,	s
587	How careful was I, when I took my way,	s
588	Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,	s
589	That to my use it might unused stay	s
590	From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!	s
591	But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,	s
592	Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,	s
593	Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,	s
594	Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?	s
595	Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,	s
596	Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,	s
597	In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;	s
598	From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;	s
599	And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,	s
600	For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.	s
601	Against that time, if ever that time come,	s
602	When I shall see thee frown on my defects,	s
603	When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,	s
604	Call'd to that audit by advised respects;	s
605	A dateless lively heat, still to endure,	s
606	Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.	s
607	Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,	s
608	Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--	s
609	Against that time do I ensconce me here	s
610	Within the knowledge of mine own desert,	s
611	And this my hand against myself uprear,	s
612	To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:	s
613	To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,	s
614	Since why to love I can allege no cause.	s
615	How heavy do I journey on the way,	s
616	When what I seek, my weary travel's end,	s
617	Doth teach that ease and that repose to say	s
618	Why so large cost, having so short a lease,	s
619	The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,	s
620	Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,	s
621	As if by some instinct the wretch did know	s
622	His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:	s
623	The bloody spur cannot provoke him on	s
624	That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;	s
625	Which heavily he answers with a groan,	s
626	More sharp to me than spurring to his side;	s
627	For that same groan doth put this in my mind;	s
628	My grief lies onward and my joy behind.	s
629	Thus can my love excuse the slow offence	s
630	Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:	s
631	From where thou art why should I haste me thence?	s
632	Till I return, of posting is no need.	s
633	O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,	s
634	When swift extremity can seem but slow?	s
635	Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;	s
636	In winged speed no motion shall I know:	s
637	Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;	s
638	But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;	s
639	Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,	s
640	Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,	s
641	The which he will not every hour survey,	s
642	For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.	s
643	Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,	s
644	Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,	s
645	Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,	s
646	Or captain jewels in the carcanet.	s
647	So is the time that keeps you as my chest,	s
648	Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,	s
649	To make some special instant special blest,	s
650	By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.	s
651	Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,	s
652	What is your substance, whereof are you made,	s
653	That millions of strange shadows on you tend?	s
654	Since every one hath, every one, one shade,	s
655	Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,	s
656	Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit	s
657	Is poorly imitated after you;	s
658	On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,	s
659	And you in Grecian tires are painted new:	s
660	Speak of the spring and foison of the year;	s
661	The one doth shadow of your beauty show,	s
662	The other as your bounty doth appear;	s
663	And you in every blessed shape we know.	s
664	In all external grace you have some part,	s
665	But you like none, none you, for constant heart.	s
666	O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem	s
667	By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!	s
668	The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem	s
669	For that sweet odour which doth in it live.	s
670	The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye	s
671	If it be not, then love doth well denote	s
672	Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly	s
673	When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:	s
674	But, for their virtue only is their show,	s
675	My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,	s
676	Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;	s
677	Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:	s
678	And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,	s
679	When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.	s
680	Not marble, nor the gilded monuments	s
681	Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;	s
682	Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.	s
683	When wasteful war shall statues overturn,	s
684	And broils root out the work of masonry,	s
685	Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn	s
686	The living record of your memory.	s
687	'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity	s
688	Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room	s
689	Even in the eyes of all posterity	s
690	Wooing his purity with her foul pride.	s
691	So, till the judgment that yourself arise,	s
692	You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.	s
693	Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said	s
694	Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,	s
695	Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,	s
696	To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:	s
697	Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,	s
698	To-morrow see again, and do not kill	s
699	The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.	s
700	Let this sad interim like the ocean be	s
701	Which parts the shore, where two contracted new	s
702	Come daily to the banks, that, when they see	s
703	Return of love, more blest may be the view;	s
704	Else call it winter, which being full of care	s
705	Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.	s
706	Being your slave, what should I do but tend	s
707	I have no precious time at all to spend,	s
708	Nor services to do, till you require.	s
709	Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour	s
710	Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,	s
711	Nor think the bitterness of absence sour	s
712	When you have bid your servant once adieu;	s
713	Nor dare I question with my jealous thought	s
714	Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,	s
715	And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep	s
716	So true a fool is love that in your will,	s
717	Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.	s
718	That god forbid that made me first your slave,	s
719	I should in thought control your times of pleasure,	s
720	Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,	s
721	To me that languish'd for her sake;	s
722	O, let me suffer, being at your beck,	s
723	The imprison'd absence of your liberty;	s
724	And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,	s
725	Without accusing you of injury.	s
726	Be where you list, your charter is so strong	s
727	That you yourself may privilege your time	s
728	To what you will; to you it doth belong	s
729	Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.	s
730	I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;	s
731	For, thou betraying me, I do betray	s
732	If there be nothing new, but that which is	s
733	Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,	s
734	Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss	s
735	The second burden of a former child!	s
736	O, that record could with a backward look,	s
737	Even of five hundred courses of the sun,	s
738	Show me your image in some antique book,	s
739	To this composed wonder of your frame;	s
740	Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,	s
741	To subjects worse have given admiring praise.	s
742	Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,	s
743	So do our minutes hasten to their end;	s
744	Each changing place with that which goes before,	s
745	In sequent toil all forwards do contend.	s
746	Nativity, once in the main of light,	s
747	Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,	s
748	And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.	s
749	Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth	s
750	And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,	s
751	Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,	s
752	And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:	s
753	And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,	s
754	Chiding that tongue that ever sweet	s
755	Is it thy will thy image should keep open	s
756	My heavy eyelids to the weary night?	s
757	Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,	s
758	While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?	s
759	Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee	s
760	So far from home into my deeds to pry,	s
761	To find out shames and idle hours in me,	s
762	O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:	s
763	It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;	s
764	Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,	s
765	To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.	s
766	To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	s
767	From me far off, with others all too near.	s
768	Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye	s
769	And all my soul and all my every part;	s
770	And for this sin there is no remedy,	s
771	It is so grounded inward in my heart.	s
772	Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,	s
773	No shape so true, no truth of such account;	s
774	And for myself mine own worth do define,	s
775	As I all other in all worths surmount.	s
776	But when my glass shows me myself indeed,	s
777	Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,	s
778	Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;	s
779	Self so self-loving were iniquity.	s
780	Do I not think on thee, when I forgot	s
781	Painting my age with beauty of thy days.	s
782	For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,	s
783	When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow	s
784	With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn	s
785	Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,	s
786	And all those beauties whereof now he's king	s
787	Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,	s
788	Stealing away the treasure of his spring;	s
789	For such a time do I now fortify	s
790	But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,	s
791	That he shall never cut from memory	s
792	This brand she quenched in a cool well by,	s
793	Two loves I have of comfort and despair,	s
794	And they shall live, and he in them still green.	s
795	When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced	s
796	The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;	s
797	But since he died and poets better prove,	s
798	And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;	s
799	When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	s
800	Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,	s
801	Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?	s
802	Increasing store with loss and loss with store;	s
803	When I have seen such interchange of state,	s
804	No matter then although my foot did stand	s
805	Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,	s
806	That Time will come and take my love away.	s
807	Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.	s
808	But weep to have that which it fears to lose.	s
809	Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,	s
810	There is such strength and warrantize of skill	s
811	How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,	s
812	Whose action is no stronger than a flower?	s
813	O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out	s
814	When rocks impregnable are not so stout,	s
815	Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?	s
816	Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,	s
817	With insufficiency my heart to sway?	s
818	Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?	s
819	On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?	s
820	Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,	s
821	That in black ink my love may still shine bright.	s
822	As, to behold desert a beggar born,	s
823	And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,	s
824	And purest faith unhappily forsworn,	s
825	And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,	s
826	And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,	s
827	And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,	s
828	And strength by limping sway disabled,	s
829	And art made tongue-tied by authority,	s
830	And folly doctor-like controlling skill,	s
831	And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,	s
832	And captive good attending captain ill:	s
833	Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,	s
834	Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.	s
835	Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,	s
836	And with his presence grace impiety,	s
837	That sin by him advantage should achieve	s
838	And lace itself with his society?	s
839	Why should false painting imitate his cheek	s
840	And steal dead seeing of his living hue?	s
841	Why should poor beauty indirectly seek	s
842	Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?	s
843	Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,	s
844	Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?	s
845	And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.	s
846	O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had	s
847	In days long since, before these last so bad.	s
848	Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.	s
849	Before the bastard signs of fair were born,	s
850	Or durst inhabit on a living brow;	s
851	Before the golden tresses of the dead,	s
852	The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,	s
853	To live a second life on second head;	s
854	Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:	s
855	In him those holy antique hours are seen,	s
856	Without all ornament, itself and true,	s
857	Making no summer of another's green,	s
858	Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;	s
859	And him as for a map doth Nature store,	s
860	To show false Art what beauty was of yore.	s
861	Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view	s
862	Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;	s
863	All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,	s
864	Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.	s
865	Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;	s
866	But those same tongues that give thee so thine own	s
867	In other accents do this praise confound	s
868	By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.	s
869	They look into the beauty of thy mind,	s
870	Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,	s
871	Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,	s
872	But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,	s
873	The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.	s
874	That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,	s
875	And all my honest faith in thee is lost,	s
876	The ornament of beauty is suspect,	s
877	A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.	s
878	So thou be good, slander doth but approve	s
879	Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;	s
880	For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,	s
881	And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.	s
882	Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,	s
883	My love is as a fever, longing still	s
884	Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,	s
885	If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,	s
886	Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.	s
887	No longer mourn for me when I am dead	s
888	Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell	s
889	Give warning to the world that I am fled	s
890	From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:	s
891	Nay, if you read this line, remember not	s
892	The hand that writ it; for I love you so	s
893	That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot	s
894	If thinking on me then should make you woe.	s
895	O, if, I say, you look upon this verse	s
896	When I perhaps compounded am with clay,	s
897	Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.	s
898	But let your love even with my life decay,	s
899	Lest the wise world should look into your moan	s
900	I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,	s
901	O, lest the world should task you to recite	s
902	What merit lived in me, that you should love	s
903	After my death, dear love, forget me quite,	s
904	For you in me can nothing worthy prove;	s
905	Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,	s
906	You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.	s
907	And hang more praise upon deceased I	s
908	Than niggard truth would willingly impart:	s
909	O, lest your true love may seem false in this,	s
910	That you for love speak well of me untrue,	s
911	My name be buried where my body is,	s
912	And live no more to shame nor me nor you.	s
913	For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,	s
914	And so should you, to love things nothing worth.	s
915	That time of year thou mayst in me behold	s
916	When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang	s
917	Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	s
918	Doth follow night, who like a fiend	s
919	As after sunset fadeth in the west,	s
920	Which by and by black night doth take away,	s
921	Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.	s
922	In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire	s
923	That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	s
924	As the death-bed whereon it must expire	s
925	Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.	s
926	Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,	s
927	To love that well which thou must leave ere long.	s
928	But be contented: when that fell arrest	s
929	Without all bail shall carry me away,	s
930	My life hath in this line some interest,	s
931	Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.	s
932	When thou reviewest this, thou dost review	s
933	The very part was consecrate to thee:	s
934	The earth can have but earth, which is his due;	s
935	My spirit is thine, the better part of me:	s
936	So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,	s
937	The prey of worms, my body being dead,	s
938	The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,	s
939	The worth of that is that which it contains,	s
940	And that is this, and this with thee remains.	s
941	Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;	s
942	And for the peace of you I hold such strife	s
943	As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;	s
944	Now proud as an enjoyer and anon	s
945	Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,	s
946	Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;	s
947	Sometime all full with feasting on your sight	s
948	And by and by clean starved for a look;	s
949	Possessing or pursuing no delight,	s
950	Save what is had or must from you be took.	s
951	Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,	s
952	Or gluttoning on all, or all away.	s
953	Why is my verse so barren of new pride,	s
954	So far from variation or quick change?	s
955	Why with the time do I not glance aside	s
956	Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep	s
957	Why write I still all one, ever the same,	s
958	And keep invention in a noted weed,	s
959	Showing their birth and where they did proceed?	s
960	O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,	s
961	And you and love are still my argument;	s
962	So all my best is dressing old words new,	s
963	Spending again what is already spent:	s
964	For as the sun is daily new and old,	s
965	So is my love still telling what is told.	s
966	Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,	s
967	Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;	s
968	In vowing new hate after new love bearing.	s
969	And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.	s
970	The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show	s
971	Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;	s
972	Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know	s
973	Time's thievish progress to eternity.	s
974	Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,	s
975	Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find	s
976	These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,	s
977	As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,	s
978	So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse	s
979	And found such fair assistance in my verse	s
980	And under thee their poesy disperse.	s
981	Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing	s
982	And heavy ignorance aloft to fly	s
983	Have added feathers to the learned's wing	s
984	And given grace a double majesty.	s
985	And by their verdict is determined	s
986	Whose influence is thine and born of thee:	s
987	In others' works thou dost but mend the style,	s
988	And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;	s
989	But thou art all my art and dost advance	s
990	As high as learning my rude ignorance.	s
991	Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,	s
992	My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,	s
993	But now my gracious numbers are decay'd	s
994	He is contented thy poor drudge to be,	s
995	I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument	s
996	And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?	s
997	Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent	s
998	He robs thee of and pays it thee again.	s
999	He lends thee virtue and he stole that word	s
1000	From thy behavior; beauty doth he give	s
1001	And found it in thy cheek; he can afford	s
1002	No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.	s
1003	Then thank him not for that which he doth say,	s
1004	Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,	s
1005	And in the praise thereof spends all his might,	s
1006	To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!	s
1007	But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,	s
1008	Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.	s
1009	That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.	s
1010	On your broad main doth wilfully appear.	s
1011	Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,	s
1012	Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;	s
1013	Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,	s
1014	He of tall building and of goodly pride:	s
1015	Then if he thrive and I be cast away,	s
1016	The worst was this; my love was my decay.	s
1017	Or I shall live your epitaph to make,	s
1018	Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;	s
1019	Although in me each part will be forgotten.	s
1020	Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:	s
1021	The earth can yield me but a common grave,	s
1022	When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.	s
1023	Your monument shall be my gentle verse,	s
1024	Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,	s
1025	And tongues to be your being shall rehearse	s
1026	When all the breathers of this world are dead;	s
1027	You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--	s
1028	Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;	s
1029	And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook	s
1030	The dedicated words which writers use	s
1031	Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	s
1032	Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,	s
1033	And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.	s
1034	And therefore art enforced to seek anew	s
1035	Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days	s
1036	And do so, love; yet when they have devised	s
1037	What strained touches rhetoric can lend,	s
1038	Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized	s
1039	In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;	s
1040	And their gross painting might be better used	s
1041	Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.	s
1042	And therefore to your fair no painting set;	s
1043	I found, or thought I found, you did exceed	s
1044	The barren tender of a poet's debt;	s
1045	And therefore have I slept in your report,	s
1046	That you yourself being extant well might show	s
1047	Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:	s
1048	Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.	s
1049	This silence for my sin you did impute,	s
1050	Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;	s
1051	For I impair not beauty being mute,	s
1052	When others would give life and bring a tomb.	s
1053	There lives more life in one of your fair eyes	s
1054	Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.	s
1055	Who is it that says most? which can say more	s
1056	Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?	s
1057	In whose confine immured is the store	s
1058	Which should example where your equal grew.	s
1059	Lean penury within that pen doth dwell	s
1060	That to his subject lends not some small glory;	s
1061	But he that writes of you, if he can tell	s
1062	That you are you, so dignifies his story,	s
1063	Not making worse what nature made so clear,	s
1064	And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,	s
1065	Making his style admired every where.	s
1066	You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,	s
1067	Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.	s
1068	While comments of your praise, richly compiled,	s
1069	I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,	s
1070	To every hymn that able spirit affords	s
1071	In polish'd form of well-refined pen.	s
1072	And to the most of praise add something more;	s
1073	But that is in my thought, whose love to you,	s
1074	Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.	s
1075	Then others for the breath of words respect,	s
1076	Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.	s
1077	Bound for the prize of all too precious you,	s
1078	That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,	s
1079	Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?	s
1080	No, neither he, nor his compeers by night	s
1081	Giving him aid, my verse astonished.	s
1082	That censures falsely what they see aright?	s
1083	Which have no correspondence with true sight!	s
1084	I was not sick of any fear from thence:	s
1085	But when your countenance fill'd up his line,	s
1086	Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.	s
1087	Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,	s
1088	And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:	s
1089	The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;	s
1090	My bonds in thee are all determinate.	s
1091	My soul doth tell my body that he may	s
1092	But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought	s
1093	The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,	s
1094	And so my patent back again is swerving.	s
1095	Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,	s
1096	So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,	s
1097	Comes home again, on better judgment making.	s
1098	Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,	s
1099	In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.	s
1100	When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,	s
1101	And place my merit in the eye of scorn,	s
1102	Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,	s
1103	And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.	s
1104	With mine own weakness being best acquainted,	s
1105	Upon thy part I can set down a story	s
1106	Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,	s
1107	That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:	s
1108	And I by this will be a gainer too;	s
1109	Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;	s
1110	The injuries that to myself I do,	s
1111	Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.	s
1112	Such is my love, to thee I so belong,	s
1113	That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.	s
1114	Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,	s
1115	And I will comment upon that offence;	s
1116	That follow'd it as gentle day	s
1117	Against thy reasons making no defence.	s
1118	My reason, the physician to my love,	s
1119	To set a form upon desired change,	s
1120	As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,	s
1121	I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,	s
1122	Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue	s
1123	Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,	s
1124	Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong	s
1125	That every word doth almost tell my name,	s
1126	For thee against myself I'll vow debate,	s
1127	For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.	s
1128	Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;	s
1129	Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,	s
1130	Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,	s
1131	This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,	s
1132	Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,	s
1133	Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;	s
1134	Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,	s
1135	To linger out a purposed overthrow.	s
1136	If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,	s
1137	When other petty griefs have done their spite	s
1138	But in the onset come; so shall I taste	s
1139	At first the very worst of fortune's might,	s
1140	And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,	s
1141	Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,	s
1142	Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,	s
1143	Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,	s
1144	Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;	s
1145	And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,	s
1146	Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:	s
1147	But these particulars are not my measure;	s
1148	All these I better in one general best.	s
1149	But when she saw my woeful state,	s
1150	Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,	s
1151	Of more delight than hawks or horses be;	s
1152	And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:	s
1153	Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take	s
1154	But being both from me, both to each friend,	s
1155	But do thy worst to steal thyself away,	s
1156	For term of life thou art assured mine,	s
1157	And life no longer than thy love will stay,	s
1158	For it depends upon that love of thine.	s
1159	Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,	s
1160	When in the least of them my life hath end.	s
1161	I see a better state to me belongs	s
1162	Than that which on thy humour doth depend;	s
1163	Suspect I may, but not directly tell;	s
1164	Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.	s
1165	O, what a happy title do I find,	s
1166	Happy to have thy love, happy to die!	s
1167	But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?	s
1168	Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.	s
1169	Like a deceived husband; so love's face	s
1170	May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;	s
1171	Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:	s
1172	For there can live no hatred in thine eye,	s
1173	Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.	s
1174	In many's looks the false heart's history	s
1175	Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,	s
1176	Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.	s
1177	That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;	s
1178	Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,	s
1179	How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,	s
1180	if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!	s
1181	They that have power to hurt and will do none,	s
1182	That do not do the thing they most do show,	s
1183	Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,	s
1184	Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,	s
1185	They rightly do inherit heaven's graces	s
1186	And husband nature's riches from expense;	s
1187	They are the lords and owners of their faces,	s
1188	Others but stewards of their excellence.	s
1189	The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,	s
1190	Though to itself it only live and die,	s
1191	But if that flower with base infection meet,	s
1192	The basest weed outbraves his dignity:	s
1193	For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;	s
1194	Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.	s
1195	How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame	s
1196	Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,	s
1197	Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!	s
1198	O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!	s
1199	That tongue that tells the story of thy days,	s
1200	Making lascivious comments on thy sport,	s
1201	Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;	s
1202	When I perceive that men as plants increase,	s
1203	O, what a mansion have those vices got	s
1204	Which for their habitation chose out thee,	s
1205	Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,	s
1206	And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove	s
1207	Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;	s
1208	The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.	s
1209	Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;	s
1210	Which like two spirits do suggest me still:	s
1211	Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;	s
1212	For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,	s
1213	As on the finger of a throned queen	s
1214	The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,	s
1215	For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,	s
1216	How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,	s
1217	If like a lamb he could his looks translate!	s
1218	How many gazers mightst thou lead away,	s
1219	If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!	s
1220	As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s
1221	How like a winter hath my absence been	s
1222	From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!	s
1223	What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!	s
1224	What old December's bareness every where!	s
1225	And yet this time removed was summer's time,	s
1226	The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,	s
1227	Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,	s
1228	Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:	s
1229	Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me	s
1230	But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;	s
1231	For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,	s
1232	And, thou away, the very birds are mute;	s
1233	Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer	s
1234	That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.	s
1235	From you have I been absent in the spring,	s
1236	How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made	s
1237	Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,	s
1238	That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.	s
1239	Of different flowers in odour and in hue	s
1240	Could make me any summer's story tell,	s
1241	Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;	s
1242	Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,	s
1243	Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;	s
1244	Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.	s
1245	Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,	s
1246	As with your shadow I with these did play:	s
1247	The forward violet thus did I chide:	s
1248	Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,	s
1249	If not from my love's breath? The purple pride	s
1250	Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells	s
1251	And haply of our old acquaintance tell.	s
1252	The lily I condemned for thy hand,	s
1253	And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:	s
1254	The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,	s
1255	One blushing shame, another white despair;	s
1256	Straight in her heart did mercy come,	s
1257	And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;	s
1258	But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth	s
1259	A vengeful canker eat him up to death.	s
1260	Holds in perfection but a little moment,	s
1261	But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.	s
1262	Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long	s
1263	To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?	s
1264	Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,	s
1265	Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?	s
1266	Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem	s
1267	In gentle numbers time so idly spent;	s
1268	Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem	s
1269	And gives thy pen both skill and argument.	s
1270	If thy unworthiness raised love in me,	s
1271	If any, be a satire to decay,	s
1272	And make Time's spoils despised every where.	s
1273	Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;	s
1274	So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.	s
1275	O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends	s
1276	For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?	s
1277	Both truth and beauty on my love depends;	s
1278	So dost thou too, and therein dignified.	s
1279	They were but sweet, but figures of delight,	s
1280	'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;	s
1281	Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;	s
1282	But best is best, if never intermix'd?'	s
1283	Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?	s
1284	Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee	s
1285	To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,	s
1286	And to be praised of ages yet to be.	s
1287	Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how	s
1288	To make him seem long hence as he shows now.	s
1289	My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;	s
1290	I love not less, though less the show appear:	s
1291	That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming	s
1292	The owner's tongue doth publish every where.	s
1293	When I was wont to greet it with my lays,	s
1294	As Philomel in summer's front doth sing	s
1295	Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,	s
1296	Not that the summer is less pleasant now	s
1297	Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,	s
1298	Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,	s
1299	And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.	s
1300	Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,	s
1301	Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand	s
1302	Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,	s
1303	That having such a scope to show her pride,	s
1304	The argument all bare is of more worth	s
1305	O, blame me not, if I no more can write!	s
1306	Look in your glass, and there appears a face	s
1307	That over-goes my blunt invention quite,	s
1308	Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.	s
1309	Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,	s
1310	To mar the subject that before was well?	s
1311	For to no other pass my verses tend	s
1312	Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;	s
1313	Was used in giving gentle doom,	s
1314	Your own glass shows you when you look in it.	s
1315	To me, fair friend, you never can be old,	s
1316	For as you were when first your eye I eyed,	s
1317	Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold	s
1318	Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,	s
1319	Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd	s
1320	In process of the seasons have I seen,	s
1321	Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,	s
1322	Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,	s
1323	Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;	s
1324	So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,	s
1325	Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:	s
1326	For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;	s
1327	Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.	s
1328	Let not my love be call'd idolatry,	s
1329	Nor my beloved as an idol show,	s
1330	Since all alike my songs and praises be	s
1331	To one, of one, still such, and ever so.	s
1332	Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,	s
1333	Still constant in a wondrous excellence;	s
1334	Therefore my verse to constancy confined,	s
1335	One thing expressing, leaves out difference.	s
1336	'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,	s
1337	To win me soon to hell, my female evil	s
1338	And in this change is my invention spent,	s
1339	Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.	s
1340	'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,	s
1341	For that which longer nurseth the disease,	s
1342	When in the chronicle of wasted time	s
1343	I see descriptions of the fairest wights,	s
1344	And beauty making beautiful old rhyme	s
1345	In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,	s
1346	Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,	s
1347	Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,	s
1348	I see their antique pen would have express'd	s
1349	Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall.	s
1350	So all their praises are but prophecies	s
1351	Of this our time, all you prefiguring;	s
1352	'I hate' she alter'd with an end,	s
1353	They had not skill enough your worth to sing:	s
1354	For we, which now behold these present days,	s
1355	Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.	s
1356	Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul	s
1357	Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.	s
1358	The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured	s
1359	And the sad augurs mock their own presage;	s
1360	Incertainties now crown themselves assured	s
1361	And peace proclaims olives of endless age.	s
1362	But do not so; I love thee in such sort	s
1363	My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,	s
1364	While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:	s
1365	And thou in this shalt find thy monument,	s
1366	When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.	s
1367	What's in the brain that ink may character	s
1368	Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?	s
1369	What's new to speak, what new to register,	s
1370	That may express my love or thy dear merit?	s
1371	Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,	s
1372	I must, each day say o'er the very same,	s
1373	The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.	s
1374	Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.	s
1375	That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?	s
1376	Weighs not the dust and injury of age,	s
1377	Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,	s
1378	But makes antiquity for aye his page,	s
1379	Finding the first conceit of love there bred	s
1380	Where time and outward form would show it dead.	s
1381	O, never say that I was false of heart,	s
1382	Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.	s
1383	As easy might I from myself depart	s
1384	As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:	s
1385	That is my home of love: if I have ranged,	s
1386	Like him that travels I return again,	s
1387	Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,	s
1388	So that myself bring water for my stain.	s
1389	Never believe, though in my nature reign'd	s
1390	All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,	s
1391	O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,	s
1392	To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;	s
1393	For nothing this wide universe I call,	s
1394	Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.	s
1395	Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there	s
1396	And made myself a motley to the view,	s
1397	Made old offences of affections new;	s
1398	Most true it is that I have look'd on truth	s
1399	Askance and strangely: but, by all above,	s
1400	These blenches gave my heart another youth,	s
1401	And worse essays proved thee my best of love.	s
1402	Now all is done, have what shall have no end:	s
1403	Mine appetite I never more will grind	s
1404	Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,	s
1405	A god in love, to whom I am confined.	s
1406	Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,	s
1407	Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.	s
1408	O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,	s
1409	The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,	s
1410	That did not better for my life provide	s
1411	Than public means which public manners breeds.	s
1412	Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,	s
1413	And almost thence my nature is subdued	s
1414	To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:	s
1415	Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;	s
1416	Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink	s
1417	My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,	s
1418	No bitterness that I will bitter think,	s
1419	Nor double penance, to correct correction.	s
1420	Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye	s
1421	Even that your pity is enough to cure me.	s
1422	To swear against the truth so foul a lie!	s
1423	Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;	s
1424	For what care I who calls me well or ill,	s
1425	So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?	s
1426	You are my all the world, and I must strive	s
1427	To know my shames and praises from your tongue:	s
1428	None else to me, nor I to none alive,	s
1429	That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.	s
1430	In so profound abysm I throw all care	s
1431	Of others' voices, that my adder's sense	s
1432	To critic and to flatterer stopped are.	s
1433	Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:	s
1434	You are so strongly in my purpose bred	s
1435	That all the world besides methinks are dead.	s
1436	Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;	s
1437	And that which governs me to go about	s
1438	Doth part his function and is partly blind,	s
1439	Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.	s
1440	Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;	s
1441	Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:	s
1442	Who taught thee how to make me love thee more	s
1443	From heaven to hell is flown away;	s
1444	For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,	s
1445	The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,	s
1446	Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?	s
1447	With all triumphant splendor on my brow;	s
1448	Incapable of more, replete with you,	s
1449	My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.	s
1450	Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,	s
1451	Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?	s
1452	The more I hear and see just cause of hate?	s
1453	And that your love taught it this alchemy,	s
1454	To make of monsters and things indigest	s
1455	Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,	s
1456	Creating every bad a perfect best,	s
1457	No want of conscience hold it that I call	s
1458	O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,	s
1459	And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:	s
1460	Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,	s
1461	And to his palate doth prepare the cup:	s
1462	If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin	s
1463	That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.	s
1464	Those lines that I before have writ do lie,	s
1465	Even those that said I could not love you dearer:	s
1466	Yet then my judgment knew no reason why	s
1467	My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.	s
1468	But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents	s
1469	Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,	s
1470	Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,	s
1471	Hath left me, and I desperate now approve	s
1472	Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,	s
1473	Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'	s
1474	When I was certain o'er incertainty,	s
1475	Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?	s
1476	Love is a babe; then might I not say so,	s
1477	To give full growth to that which still doth grow?	s
1478	Let me not to the marriage of true minds	s
1479	Admit impediments. Love is not love	s
1480	Which alters when it alteration finds,	s
1481	Or bends with the remover to remove:	s
1482	O no! it is an ever-fixed mark	s
1483	That looks on tempests and is never shaken;	s
1484	Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks	s
1485	Within his bending sickle's compass come:	s
1486	Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,	s
1487	If this be error and upon me proved,	s
1488	I never writ, nor no man ever loved.	s
1489	Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all	s
1490	Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	s
1491	Tempteth my better angel from my side,	s
1492	Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;	s
1493	And given to time your own dear-purchased right	s
1494	That I have hoisted sail to all the winds	s
1495	Which should transport me farthest from your sight.	s
1496	Book both my wilfulness and errors down	s
1497	And on just proof surmise accumulate;	s
1498	Bring me within the level of your frown,	s
1499	But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;	s
1500	Since my appeal says I did strive to prove	s
1501	The constancy and virtue of your love.	s
1502	Like as, to make our appetites more keen,	s
1503	With eager compounds we our palate urge,	s
1504	As, to prevent our maladies unseen,	s
1505	We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,	s
1506	Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,	s
1507	To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding	s
1508	And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness	s
1509	To be diseased ere that there was true needing.	s
1510	Thus policy in love, to anticipate	s
1511	The ills that were not, grew to faults assured	s
1512	And brought to medicine a healthful state	s
1513	Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:	s
1514	Now counting best to be with you alone,	s
1515	Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.	s
1516	Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,	s
1517	Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,	s
1518	Still losing when I saw myself to win!	s
1519	What wretched errors hath my heart committed,	s
1520	Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!	s
1521	How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	s
1522	In the distraction of this madding fever!	s
1523	O benefit of ill! now I find true	s
1524	That better is by evil still made better;	s
1525	My nobler part to my gross body's treason;	s
1526	Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.	s
1527	So I return rebuked to my content	s
1528	And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.	s
1529	That you were once unkind befriends me now,	s
1530	And for that sorrow which I then did feel	s
1531	Needs must I under my transgression bow,	s
1532	Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.	s
1533	For if you were by my unkindness shaken	s
1534	As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,	s
1535	And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken	s
1536	O, that our night of woe might have remember'd	s
1537	My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,	s
1538	And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd	s
1539	And each, though enemies to either's reign,	s
1540	But that your trespass now becomes a fee;	s
1541	Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.	s
1542	'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,	s
1543	When not to be receives reproach of being,	s
1544	And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd	s
1545	Thyself away art resent still with me;	s
1546	For why should others false adulterate eyes	s
1547	Give salutation to my sportive blood?	s
1548	Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,	s
1549	Which in their wills count bad what I think good?	s
1550	No, I am that I am, and they that level	s
1551	At my abuses reckon up their own:	s
1552	I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;	s
1553	By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;	s
1554	Unless this general evil they maintain,	s
1555	All men are bad, and in their badness reign.	s
1556	Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain	s
1557	Full character'd with lasting memory,	s
1558	Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love	s
1559	Beyond all date, even to eternity;	s
1560	Or at the least, so long as brain and heart	s
1561	Have faculty by nature to subsist;	s
1562	That in the very refuse of thy deeds	s
1563	Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.	s
1564	That poor retention could not so much hold,	s
1565	Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;	s
1566	Therefore to give them from me was I bold,	s
1567	To trust those tables that receive thee more:	s
1568	To keep an adjunct to remember thee	s
1569	Were to import forgetfulness in me.	s
1570	No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:	s
1571	Thy pyramids built up with newer might	s
1572	To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;	s
1573	They are but dressings of a former sight.	s
1574	Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire	s
1575	Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write	s
1576	And rather make them born to our desire	s
1577	Than think that we before have heard them told.	s
1578	Thy registers and thee I both defy,	s
1579	Not wondering at the present nor the past,	s
1580	O, from what power hast thou this powerful might	s
1581	Made more or less by thy continual haste.	s
1582	This I do vow and this shall ever be;	s
1583	I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.	s
1584	If my dear love were but the child of state,	s
1585	It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'	s
1586	As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,	s
1587	Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.	s
1588	No, it was builded far from accident;	s
1589	It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls	s
1590	Under the blow of thralled discontent,	s
1591	Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:	s
1592	It fears not policy, that heretic,	s
1593	Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,	s
1594	But all alone stands hugely politic,	s
1595	That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.	s
1596	To this I witness call the fools of time,	s
1597	Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.	s
1598	Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,	s
1599	With my extern the outward honouring,	s
1600	But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	s
1601	Which prove more short than waste or ruining?	s
1602	Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour	s
1603	Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,	s
1604	For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,	s
1605	Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?	s
1606	No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,	s
1607	And take thou my oblation, poor but free,	s
1608	Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,	s
1609	But mutual render, only me for thee.	s
1610	Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul	s
1611	When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.	s
1612	Now with the drops of this most balmy time	s
1613	Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;	s
1614	Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st	s
1615	Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;	s
1616	If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,	s
1617	As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,	s
1618	She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill	s
1619	May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.	s
1620	Love is too young to know what conscience is;	s
1621	She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:	s
1622	Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,	s
1623	And her quietus is to render thee.	s
1624	In the old age black was not counted fair,	s
1625	Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;	s
1626	But now is black beauty's successive heir,	s
1627	And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:	s
1628	For since each hand hath put on nature's power,	s
1629	Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,	s
1630	Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,	s
1631	But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.	s
1632	Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,	s
1633	Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem	s
1634	At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,	s
1635	Slandering creation with a false esteem:	s
1636	Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,	s
1637	How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,	s
1638	Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds	s
1639	What merit do I in myself respect,	s
1640	The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,	s
1641	Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap	s
1642	To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,	s
1643	And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,	s
1644	But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,	s
1645	To be so tickled, they would change their state	s
1646	And situation with those dancing chips,	s
1647	O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,	s
1648	Making dead wood more blest than living lips.	s
1649	Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,	s
1650	Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.	s
1651	At random from the truth vainly express'd;	s
1652	Is lust in action; and till action, lust	s
1653	Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,	s
1654	Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,	s
1655	Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,	s
1656	Past reason hunted, and no sooner had	s
1657	Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait	s
1658	On purpose laid to make the taker mad;	s
1659	Mad in pursuit and in possession so;	s
1660	Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;	s
1661	A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;	s
1662	Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.	s
1663	All this the world well knows; yet none knows well	s
1664	To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.	s
1665	The uncertain sickly appetite to please.	s
1666	Coral is far more red than her lips' red;	s
1667	If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;	s
1668	For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,	s
1669	I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,	s
1670	But no such roses see I in her cheeks;	s
1671	And in some perfumes is there more delight	s
1672	Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.	s
1673	I love to hear her speak, yet well I know	s
1674	I grant I never saw a goddess go;	s
1675	My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:	s
1676	And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare	s
1677	As any she belied with false compare.	s
1678	In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,	s
1679	As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;	s
1680	For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart	s
1681	Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.	s
1682	The little Love-god lying once asleep	s
1683	Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:	s
1684	To say they err I dare not be so bold,	s
1685	Although I swear it to myself alone.	s
1686	And, to be sure that is not false I swear,	s
1687	A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,	s
1688	One on another's neck, do witness bear	s
1689	Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.	s
1690	In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,	s
1691	And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.	s
1692	Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,	s
1693	Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,	s
1694	Have put on black and loving mourners be,	s
1695	Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.	s
1696	And truly not the morning sun of heaven	s
1697	Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,	s
1698	Nor that full star that ushers in the even	s
1699	Doth half that glory to the sober west,	s
1700	As those two mourning eyes become thy face:	s
1701	O, let it then as well beseem thy heart	s
1702	Growing a bath and healthful remedy	s
1703	And suit thy pity like in every part.	s
1704	Then will I swear beauty herself is black	s
1705	And all they foul that thy complexion lack.	s
1706	Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan	s
1707	For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!	s
1708	If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.	s
1709	But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?	s
1710	And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:	s
1711	Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;	s
1712	A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.	s
1713	For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye,	s
1714	But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;	s
1715	Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;	s
1716	Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:	s
1717	And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,	s
1718	What means the world to say it is not so?	s
1719	So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,	s
1720	And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,	s
1721	Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine	s
1722	Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:	s
1723	But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,	s
1724	For thou art covetous and he is kind;	s
1725	He learn'd but surety-like to write for me	s
1726	Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.	s
1727	The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,	s
1728	Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,	s
1729	Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.	s
1730	So him I lose through my unkind abuse.	s
1731	Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:	s
1732	He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.	s
1733	Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'	s
1734	To thee I send this written embassage,	s
1735	More than enough am I that vex thee still,	s
1736	To thy sweet will making addition thus.	s
1737	Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,	s
1738	Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?	s
1739	Shall will in others seem right gracious,	s
1740	And in my will no fair acceptance shine?	s
1741	The sea all water, yet receives rain still	s
1742	And in abundance addeth to his store;	s
1743	So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'	s
1744	One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.	s
1745	Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;	s
1746	Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'	s
1747	If thy soul check thee that I come so near,	s
1748	Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'	s
1749	So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,	s
1750	Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.	s
1751	'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,	s
1752	Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.	s
1753	In things of great receipt with ease we prove	s
1754	Among a number one is reckon'd none:	s
1755	That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:	s
1756	Though in thy stores' account I one must be;	s
1757	For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold	s
1758	That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:	s
1759	And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'	s
1760	Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,	s
1761	That they behold, and see not what they see?	s
1762	They know what beauty is, see where it lies,	s
1763	Yet what the best is take the worst to be.	s
1764	If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks	s
1765	Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,	s
1766	Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,	s
1767	From hence your memory death cannot take,	s
1768	Why should my heart think that a several plot	s
1769	Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?	s
1770	Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,	s
1771	To put fair truth upon so foul a face?	s
1772	In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,	s
1773	And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.	s
1774	Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.	s
1775	I do believe her, though I know she lies,	s
1776	That she might think me some untutor'd youth,	s
1777	Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.	s
1778	Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	s
1779	Although she knows my days are past the best,	s
1780	Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:	s
1781	On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.	s
1782	Yet be most proud of that which I compile,	s
1783	O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,	s
1784	And age in love loves not to have years told:	s
1785	Therefore I lie with her and she with me,	s
1786	And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.	s
1787	O, call not me to justify the wrong	s
1788	That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;	s
1789	Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;	s
1790	Use power with power and slay me not by art.	s
1791	Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,	s
1792	Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:	s
1793	What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might	s
1794	Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?	s
1795	Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows	s
1796	Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,	s
1797	And therefore from my face she turns my foes,	s
1798	Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,	s
1799	Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.	s
1800	Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press	s
1801	My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;	s
1802	Lest sorrow lend me words and words express	s
1803	The manner of my pity-wanting pain.	s
1804	If I might teach thee wit, better it were,	s
1805	Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;	s
1806	As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,	s
1807	No news but health from their physicians know;	s
1808	For if I should despair, I should grow mad,	s
1809	And in my madness might speak ill of thee:	s
1810	Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	s
1811	Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,	s
1812	That I may not be so, nor thou belied,	s
1813	Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.	s
1814	In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,	s
1815	For they in thee a thousand errors note;	s
1816	But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,	s
1817	Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;	s
1818	Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,	s
1819	Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,	s
1820	Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited	s
1821	To any sensual feast with thee alone:	s
1822	But my five wits nor my five senses can	s
1823	Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,	s
1824	Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,	s
1825	Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:	s
1826	Only my plague thus far I count my gain,	s
1827	That she that makes me sin awards me pain.	s
1828	Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,	s
1829	Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:	s
1830	O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,	s
1831	And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;	s
1832	Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,	s
1833	That have profaned their scarlet ornaments	s
1834	And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;	s
1835	Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.	s
1836	Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those	s
1837	Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:	s
1838	Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows	s
1839	Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.	s
1840	If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,	s
1841	By self-example mayst thou be denied!	s
1842	Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch	s
1843	One of her feather'd creatures broke away,	s
1844	Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?	s
1845	In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,	s
1846	Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,	s
1847	Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent	s
1848	To follow that which flies before her face,	s
1849	Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;	s
1850	So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,	s
1851	If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,	s
1852	But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,	s
1853	And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:	s
1854	So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'	s
1855	Has checked the outlaw's way ; 	b
1856	Ah ! my dear father, tell me why ? 	b
1857	But what shall brave the deep, deep waves 	b
1858	And gives the waves a brighter blue, 	b
1859	Stooped, and raised his languid head ; 	b
1860	Subdue this quenchless will ! ' 	b
1861	He felt for all the beauty there. 	b
1862	Turn back, from that tempestuous surge, 	b
1863	Before it fades away ! 	b
1864	When winter winds were wild . 	b
1865	Warm and bright on Arden's lake 	b
1866	All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given, 	b
1867	Who motionless is laid . . . 	b
1868	Of southern waters breaking to the wind, 	b
1869	And laughter sink into a sigh, 	b
1870	Their sunlit isles of paradise, 	b
1871	The vain man smile, the fool deride, 	b
1872	4 This is my home where whirlwinds blow, 	b
1873	1 'd call forth the glorious chorus again 	b
1874	With blood on his hand that he wept to have shed ? 	b
1875	The space between is all forgot, 	b
1876	* But, I '11 not fear, I will not weep 	b
1877	Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night ; 	b
1878	I have one rite a gentle kiss ; 	b
1879	When those who were thy own compeers, 	b
1880	All Nature's million mysteries, 	b
1881	To reach, at last, the eternal home, 	b
1882	Was flitting o'er me evermore. 	b
1883	But something whispers to my mind, 	b
1884	What though the stars and fair moonlight 	b
1885	And who with unregretful eyes 	b
1886	But sweet was the slight and spicy smell 	b
1887	Opening its ports for me and mine ; 	b
1888	Implored to change for senseless rest 	b
1889	How still, how happy ! These are words 	b
1890	And what is thine that it should prove 	b
1891	And fresh winds shook the door ; 	b
1892	That I shall greet them ne'er again ! ' 	b
1893	Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain ; 	b
1894	And conquered good and conquering ill 	b
1895	Gladly to see his gory sun 	b
1896	Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave- 	b
1897	Is human love so true ? 	b
1898	The strength of eyesight to restore 	b
1899	My monarch died to rule for ever 	b
1900	Unawed, the darkness of the grave ? 	b
1901	Which wilder visions muster'd to my mind ; 	b
1902	Clothe in blood its sovereign's prayer. 	b
1903	Hark ! listen to the distant gun 	b
1904	Yet vainly flowed the calmer wave 	b
1905	None need point the princely victim, 	b
1906	* And now, 'mid northern mountains lone 	b
1907	Are warring night and day ; 	b
1908	From those brown hills, have melted into spring : 	b
1909	On the shady side reclined 	b
1910	On antique roof and hoary tree, 	b
1911	That flush of roseate light, 	b
1912	None but me beheld him dying, 	b
1913	No ; 'twas not the flowery plain : 	b
1914	Has Almadore in battle bled ! 	b
1915	The yells, the groans, the frenzied gladness, 	b
1916	Their careless young eyes are closed in sleeping ; 	b
1917	T' escape from labour's tyrant power 	b
1918	November's gusts unheeded call ; 	b
1919	Doth he not rather roam ? 	b
1920	And glowed both roof and floor ; 	b
1921	And not one of all my lays 	b
1922	1 Ice has barred the Arctic waters, 	b
1923	The future fills me with dismay ; 	b
1924	Felt, but unseen, the damp dewdrops fall. 	b
1925	From those eternal waves that surge below. 	b
1926	Rattled against an old vault's rail. 	b
1927	When that grim concave frowned above, 	b
1928	A thoughtful spirit taught me soon, 	b
1929	There if he can to die alone ? ' 	b
1930	When it has worn through many a week 	b
1931	Because thy soul is clear ; 	b
1932	For ever triumphing : 	b
1933	Too truly agonised to weep, 	b
1934	Through wind and ocean's roar, 	b
1935	The face, all deadly fair, 	b
1936	Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire, 	b
1937	AH ! why, because the dazzling sun 	b
1938	But voiceless silence everywhere. 	b
1939	December's sullen time ! 	b
1940	Hope soothes me in the griefs I know ; 	b
1941	Can rob us of the past. 	b
1942	That now I cannot feel ! 	b
1943	That Death he took a certain aim, 	b
1944	The grave is drear, but they are not there : 	b
1945	Away, away, resign thee now 	b
1946	How every drift in their glens profound 	b
1947	Or bless not me with heaven ! * 	b
1948	There is no need of other sound 	b
1949	Of youth's delight, when youth is past, 	b
1950	Day by day some dreary token 	b
1951	But hope is dead for him. 	b
1952	She scarcely feels the flow ; 	b
1953	Faltering, faint, and ready to die. 	b
1954	Begins another voyage nay, they 're gone ; 	b
1955	1 see them foaming high ; 	b
1956	Before their hearts went wandering wrong, 	b
1957	From tracking farther day by day, 	b
1958	Day breathes such beauty over earth and sky, 	b
1959	Raised on my pillow, to descry 	b
1960	And, in the red fire's cheerful glow, 	b
1961	And Lord Eldred glancing round, 	b
1962	And thou false friend and treacherous guide 	b
1963	And never radiant bow could be 	b
1964	Drinks tears, instead of dew ; 	b
1965	A winter sunset in the west 	b
1966	A faithless heart to thee ? 	b
1967	And let Thy holy Spirit shine 	b
1968	Darken that triumphant eye ! 	b
1969	Blood-red, he rose, and, arrow-straight, 	b
1970	Where tears and mourning cannot come. 	b
1971	That wander down to drink the tide. 	b
1972	Enough if storms have bowed his head, 	b
1973	Even Memory's voice grew dim ; 	b
1974	For round their hearths they'll tell this 	b
1975	Yet, loved one, it must be : 	b
1976	More drear I cannot be ! 	b
1977	Those sad relics scattered round ; 	b
1978	The giant sons of Anakim 	b
1979	Sweet, how softly sweet it came 	b
1980	And all around his youthful brow 	b
1981	With alien breezes sadly blent. 	b
1982	All her cherished hopes should wane, 	b
1983	SWART steed of night, thou hast charged thy last 	b
1984	Its face is fair divinely fair ; 	b
1985	It will not, cannot rise ; 	b
1986	But if that night bring only sleep, 	b
1987	Deep in unknown eternity ; 	b
1988	How could I seek the empty world again ? 	b
1989	My eyes are full of tears, 	b
1990	No later light has lightened up my heaven, 	b
1991	Where evening closes dark and chill ; 	b
1992	The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the 	b
1993	Concludes thy musing once again ? 	b
1994	' O DAY ! he cannot die 	b
1995	To breathe its bliss on me ; 	b
1996	Through this false world, their all had 	b
1997	The stream in silence sang once more 	b
1998	And woke her with a sudden song ; 	b
1999	Roderic, for thee shall never rise ! 	b
2000	With my consoling tear? 	b
2001	To the enduring seas 	b
2002	THE ABSENT ONE 	b
2003	O then another daybreak 	b
2004	And grew in another bed ; 	b
2005	1 Oh, for the time when I shall sleep 	b
2006	DREAM, where art thou now ? 	b
2007	Such tears as I weep it is not so ! 	b
2008	And voiceless, soulless, messenger, 	b
2009	O gallant horse, hold on thy course ; 	b
2010	But still they gave no certain token 	b
2011	The captive raised her face ; it was as soft and 	b
2012	To the deadliest press of the gathering fight 	b
2013	Though not because my heart is tame, 	b
2014	' And why should we be glad at all ? 	b
2015	Oh, for the day, when I shall rest, 	b
2016	Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine ; 	b
2017	1 And thou art gone with all thy pride ; 	b
2018	They were clothed in savage attire ; 	b
2019	For the woe I could not bear 	b
2020	Than other love, more true? 	b
2021	Must always fade, and always cloy : 	b
2022	One long look, that sore reproved me 	b
2023	I am thinking of my latest shock, 	b
2024	For now might Faith decay. 	b
2025	Sit beneath the ancient thorn. 	b
2026	And morning's beams will rise as drear. 	b
2027	Their happy souls are gone to God I 	b
2028	Buried in a hapless tomb. 	b
2029	Clouded, even as they would weep. 	b
2030	And, while the wide earth echoing rung 	b
2031	I ne'er had raised this coward cry 	b
2032	To leave our children slaves ! 	b
2033	She heard the river's restless wave 	b
2034	The vast crowds vanished every one ; 	b
2035	And 'mid flowery, smiling plains ; 	b
2036	That we may overflow the sky 	b
2037	I shall smile when wreaths of snow 	b
2038	Till the tufted leaves of the garden bower 	b
2039	But not of wail for men ! 	b
2040	Ah ! no : with louder sound 	b
2041	Gone by as if they 'd never been ; 	b
2042	No ; turn towards the western side. 	b
2043	Or unreal phantoms of distress ! 	b
2044	Her spirit is the unfathomed lake 	b
2045	Adoring virtue's distant star. 	b
2046	ON a sunny brae alone I lay 	b
2047	Wrought up in rain and wailing wind : 	b
2048	Youthful he seemed but worn as they 	b
2049	THE evening sun was sinking down 	b
2050	Exhausted with repinings vain, 	b
2051	The grass-grown grave, did lie, 	b
2052	Daughter divine ! and could his gaze 	b
2053	Where will these bright things be ? 	b
2054	The grand remains of ancient state. 	b
2055	And, all for listening, never sleep. 	b
2056	In all His works displayed. 	b
2057	To greet the general glow. 	b
2058	With a wild and passing thrill, 	b
2059	Are shadowed by her hand at last 	b
2060	grant thy prayer ? 	b
2061	To wander through the snow. 	b
2062	Nor ever let my spirit tire, 	b
2063	And while on that reflected face 	b
2064	And cold suspicion never rise ; 	b
2065	Where thou, and I, and Liberty, 	b
2066	Burned within the avenging flame : 	b
2067	It is but thought full many a night 	b
2068	For them a thousand hopes remain, 	b
2069	The evening comes before the noon, 	b
2070	With heart as summer sunshine light 	b
2071	A wanderer o'er the Atlantic main ; 	b
2072	Till sorrow's source were dry, 	b
2073	Could that sacrifice have purchased 	b
2074	Its green boughs in the breezy sky. 	b
2075	And cheek almost as white as death, 	b
2076	Was it with the fields of green, 	b
2077	Have long forgot their vow ; 	b
2078	The flowers of Fancy, newly-blown : 	b
2079	The starry halls of Elrington 	b
2080	This glorious vision of a grove, 	b
2081	New glories o'er the blighted spring, 	b
2082	Wild the road, and rough and dreary ; 	b
2083	And yet there is or seems at least to be 	b
2084	1 Our guests are darkly lodged,' I whisper'd, gazing 	b
2085	And only wake with you ! 	b
2086	Bowed lowest at thy shrine, 	b
2087	The little glittering spirits sung, 	b
2088	And every vision of old Afric's shore 	b
2089	And my remorse shall die. 	b
2090	And sweeter hope, when hope despairs ! 	b
2091	When the wearied host of the conqueror lies 	b
2092	And the purple violet sweet ; 	b
2093	This day on Elmor Hill ! ! ! ' 	b
2094	While heaven and earth are whispering me, 	b
2095	His own creation's dread despair ! 	b
2096	King Julius lifts his impious eye 	b
2097	Round her returning sight appear 	b
2098	In English fields my limbs were laid, 	b
2099	I dreamt one dark and stormy night 	b
2100	The spirit sent his dazzling gaze 	b
2101	It gathers up thoughts akin to madness, 	b
2102	My heart's blood flows to buy the blessing to 	b
2103	I was at peace, and drank your beams 	b
2104	Might fill with sympathy. 	b
2105	To twilight's shade forlorn ? 	b
2106	What made her weep, what made her glide 	b
2107	A wider sound than mountain wind 	b
2108	Yet still steeped in memory's dyes 	b
2109	Above me, in that stormless sea, 	b
2110	I long to hope that all the woe 	b
2111	In summer's pride imbue 	b
2112	Then I shall rest, while thou wilt weep. 	b
2113	Yet ever in my grateful breast 	b
2114	Where thick the leaves are dancing, 	b
2115	It was thus I said as her graceful head 	b
2116	My mortal flesh you might debar, 	b
2117	They gain the rock's steep wall. 	b
2118	Ye earthly cares begone ! 	b
2119	Or Virtue crouched to Infamy ; 	b
2120	For I Ve been consecrate to grief 	b
2121	Some were dazzling like the sun ; 	b
2122	That struggles in thy breast 	b
2123	A murmuring round the wall. 	b
2124	My downy couch with silk was hung. 	b
2125	And helpless Reason warn in vain ; 	b
2126	Glides through the maze of pleasure wild. 	b
2127	And Peace, the lethargy of Grief ; 	b
2128	And Hope, a phantom of the soul ; 	b
2129	He ever held in his arms. 	b
2130	LADYBIRD ! ladybird ! fly away home, 	b
2131	And trembling yet to hear his name, 	b
2132	While nightly stars are burning, 	b
2133	While evening pours its silent dew, 	b
2134	And will not heaven itself bestow 	b
2135	I trust not to thy phantom bliss, 	b
2136	'My master's voice is low, his aspect bland and 	b
2137	Yet the faint wind comes soothingly 	b
2138	Round walls where only you are vigil keeping? 	b
2139	To-morrow both shall soar away, 	b
2140	Winds sigh as you are sighing, 	b
2141	Entreating, till his eyes o'erflowed, 	b
2142	Gaze on the wretch recall to mind 	b
2143	My spirit should startle their rest and tell, 	b
2144	Since misery was such misery. 	b
2145	To dungeons where a prisoner lies? 	b
2146	PLEAD FOR ME 	b
2147	STILL beside that dreary water 	b
2148	And now the twilight calm and sweet 	b
2149	They stood by mute and pale ; 	b
2150	Restored into the Deity.' 	b
2151	And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
2152	A prayer that would come forth altho' it lingered 	b
2153	And twenty years of tyrant pride 	b
2154	O'er all the crossing thoughts that overflowed. 	b
2155	No, radiant angel, speak and say 	b
2156	And it sprung and flourished ; 	b
2157	Thou bear'st the dim tie of ceaseless dreams, 	b
2158	The earth shone round with a long-lost charm : 	b
2159	For Thine own sake, be Thou its guide, 	b
2160	It had gathered beauty from sunshine and shower, 	b
2161	BETWEEN distress and pleasure 	b
2162	Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays, 	b
2163	The moor-lark in the air, 	b
2164	And saw my offerings on their shrine ; 	b
2165	I thought that Gabriel's self had come 	b
2166	Weighed beneath a mortal sleep ; 	b
2167	So, with a ready heart, I swore 	b
2168	To seek their altar-stone no more ; 	b
2169	His soul has felt the storm below, 	b
2170	Behold him 1 	b
2171	And set my spirit free ? 	b
2172	He must have once been beautiful, 	b
2173	Because we dare not stay to gain 	b
2174	Like vultures round their prey. 	b
2175	A weak and helpless prey ! 	b
2176	How loud the storm sounds round the hall ! 	b
2177	My darling pain that wounds and sears, 	b
2178	Rude the couch that rests us weary ; 	b
2179	Rested from the battle's roar ; 	b
2180	As she would seek repose ; 	b
2181	Mine eye to meet her eye ; 	b
2182	And am I wrong to worship where 	b
2183	wind that blows ; 	b
2184	Of heavy rain or tempest near. 	b
2185	Would part and sunlight shone between, 	b
2186	And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
2187	* THE evening passes fast away, 	b
2188	Lips, that did breathe no murmuring 	b
2189	The wild birds raise their brood ; 	b
2190	What feelings in thy breast?' 	b
2191	One moment, ere I go 	b
2192	Of labour hardly done ; 	b
2193	A thousand thousand silvery lyres 	b
2194	But this world's life has much to dread, 	b
2195	What shadow is it 	b
2196	Bliss like thine is bought by years 	b
2197	'Tis sweet to wander here at night, 	b
2198	I 'M happiest now when most away 	b
2199	One gleam of her heaven-bright face to see. 	b
2200	And Time should Fate condemn ; 	b
2201	Which coming death denied ; 	b
2202	* Then art thou glad to seek repose ? 	b
2203	The bee among the heather bells 	b
2204	AND first an hour of mournful musing, 	b
2205	And earth looks back so dazzling bright 	b
2206	As the dear friend untimely called away ; 	b
2207	And call a lovelier Life from Death, 	b
2208	I breathed not but to send above 	b
2209	That comforts me while thou art here, 	b
2210	Palace and temple crown the glade. 	b
2211	As one who mourns the dead. 	b
2212	Why did the morning dawn to break 	b
2213	And would not pass away ! 	b
2214	Lament their absence drear ; 	b
2215	Over my western beauty's grave, 	b
2216	Patriot fathers' bloody tombs ; 	b
2217	Would rather fight than rest. ' 	b
2218	No ; that tree with branches riven 	b
2219	And sleet and frozen gloom ? 	b
2220	With my dear comrades young and gay, 	b
2221	This very crowd is vacancy ; 	b
2222	I chide with my soul I bid it cherish 	b
2223	From bleak December's sky ? 	b
2224	They deluge my heart like the rain 	b
2225	Within its mossy cell. 	b
2226	How gloomy grows the night ! Tis Gondal's 	b
2227	But God is not like human kind, 	b
2228	Shall meet our dearest, when we die ; 	b
2229	Buried in moors and mountains wild, 	b
2230	Defeat serenely borne, 	b
2231	Which but because more broken gleams 	b
2232	And visions rise, and change, that kill me with 	b
2233	The tiny fountain, churning spray 	b
2234	Saved thee from a deadlier thrall. 	b
2235	Even where he yearns to be I 	b
2236	From the fresh root of Eternity ! 	b
2237	And I may sing and muse aloud, 	b
2238	Their timid forms to guard from harm ; 	b
2239	I love thee, boy, for all divine, 	b
2240	From the dark marble to the sky, 	b
2241	Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom ; 	b
2242	And hush that music's solemn sound, 	b
2243	But, within its parent's kindly bosom, 	b
2244	My love, altho' the very dead 	b
2245	Without the veil between. 	b
2246	Can friendship's flower droop for years 	b
2247	Will forsake thy memory, 	b
2248	All mist and tempest free? 	b
2249	And, behold ! with tenfold increase blessing, 	b
2250	Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray ; 	b
2251	The moonbeams softly shine. 	b
2252	For many a week and many a day 	b
2253	The waveless ocean of repose. 	b
2254	Than Native's heaven can pour. 	b
2255	Down through that ocean's gloomy night ; 	b
2256	Cruel Death ! The young leaves droop and 	b
2257	When flowers were closed and day was o'er 	b
2258	No ! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish 	b
2259	The thrilling shouts of fighting men, 	b
2260	She was cruel in her fear ; 	b
2261	Was only sullen there ! 	b
2262	If our vessels sailed adverse on life's stormy main. 	b
2263	AT CASTLE WOOD 	b
2264	But as in fit of peevish woe, 	b
2265	'Cumber the spirit that would soar 	b
2266	The outward tumult seemed to assuage 	b
2267	Out to the park this dreary day, 	b
2268	She turns from heaven a tearless eye 	b
2269	Even weeping o'er that wretch's woe ; 	b
2270	And mingled with a foreign mould. 	b
2271	One sign of sympathising woe, 	b
2272	A snowy brow in ringlets small, 	b
2273	Till at last, all old links broken, 	b
2274	Vain as thou wert, and weak as vain, 	b
2275	Make answer far and near. 	b
2276	And this is just the joyous hour 	b
2277	Thy soul is powerless over mine.' 	b
2278	She would not, in her tranquil sleep, 	b
2279	She thought when that confession crossed 	b
2280	Do I despise the timid deer, 	b
2281	Chain and bar and dungeon wall 	b
2282	And heaven itself, so pure and blest, 	b
2283	And still entreated him to stay. 	b
2284	And he was once an ardent boy ; 	b
2285	I saw His wisdom and His power 	b
2286	And nothing in the twilight sky 	b
2287	How can I rouse my sinking soul 	b
2288	Say, ' Earth, lie lightly on that breast, 	b
2289	Tortured Gondal's liberty ! 	b
2290	The wind blew from the sea. 	b
2291	But the joy of life was flown 	b
2292	And every window glistens bright 	b
2293	With leaves of frozen dew. 	b
2294	O look again, for still on high 	b
2295	And lights your room like day ; 	b
2296	Bright be thine eyes, undimmed their dazzling 	b
2297	We thought, t When winter comes again. 	b
2298	Ere I would call its glories mine ; 	b
2299	Its root has felt a worm, 	b
2300	Why dost thou repeat again 	b
2301	Till those dark orbs o'erflowing fast 	b
2302	4 Listen ! I Ve known a burning heart, 	b
2303	' Edward, awake, awake 	b
2304	And every time its measured call 	b
2305	A thousand forms, a fearful gloom ; 	b
2306	Or gleams the sun amongst the mists of care? 	b
2307	' When tempests roar on the lonely shore 	b
2308	The aimless, heedless carelessness 	b
2309	His red heart's blood drenched my dagger ; 	b
2310	The music of the Sabbath bell. 	b
2311	The sunshine of a summer's sun 	b
2312	My cold heart, underneath my hand, 	b
2313	Or wakes the breeze in the swaying trees 	b
2314	THE day is done, the winter sun 	b
2315	The heart is dead in infancy, 	b
2316	To hide the streaming tear. 	b
2317	Nor marked how from his own young 	b
2318	To-morrow, Scorn will blight my name, 	b
2319	Thus poured she in that cavern wild 	b
2320	Will load me with a coward's shame 	b
2321	'Twas thus I thought, an hour ago, 	b
2322	And at each belt a weapon dire, 	b
2323	Too heavenly now, but doomed to be, 	b
2324	I cannot find a haven. 	b
2325	When thy heart bounds ardently, 	b
2326	His followers went out with Jubilee, 	b
2327	Their dust is mingled with the sod, 	b
2328	Should cause such bitter woe? 	b
2329	Sad thoughts rose in my mind. 	b
2330	For, who forgives the accursed crime 	b
2331	The violet's eye might shyly flash, 	b
2332	OH, thy bright eyes must answer now, 	b
2333	Thy presence waked a thrilling tone 	b
2334	Where can the weary lay his head, 	b
2335	There have been times when this was drear, 	b
2336	But, traitor, traitor, from that word 	b
2337	All true breasts shrink away ! 	b
2338	The spirit above my couch was bending. 	b
2339	A slave, because I rule thee still ; 	b
2340	As I can hear the ocean's fall 	b
2341	My honour's name to spare ! 	b
2342	And earth seemed such an alien home 	b
2343	* What seek you now on this bleak moor brow, 	b
2344	A sound of music reached my ear : 	b
2345	And there you pass, in happy dreams, 	b
2346	Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 	b
2347	Into hopeless, endless mourning. 	b
2348	All those disturbed waves decrease 	b
2349	Stern duty stores for me. 	b
2350	Every leaf speaks bliss to me, 	b
2351	That thou didst visit me? 	b
2352	Though it roar in thunder wild, 	b
2353	Tears have left ghastly traces there, 	b
2354	I AM the only being whose doom 	b
2355	And doubly will the dark world grieve me, 	b
2356	Fast asleep and almost dying, 	b
2357	Are brushing off the scented dew, 	b
2358	Must always end in gloom ; 	b
2359	Midnight moonlight's holy shrine. 	b
2360	It closes with a tomb ! 	b
2361	From thought of grief are free. 	b
2362	Danger, and guilt, and darkness lie, 	b
2363	Weary to watch the spirit languish 	b
2364	Through years of dead despair. 	b
2365	So, if a tear, when thou art dying, 	b
2366	Since I beheld another dwelling. 	b
2367	When I am not, and none beside, 	b
2368	For wild those gusts, and well their chimes 	b
2369	That cold departure pictures mine. 	b
2370	My deadliest pains might die ; 	b
2371	False she was, and unrelenting ; 	b
2372	Seems it not that eve's declining 	b
2373	Of dastard treachery ? 	b
2374	Though comet-like its course was run ; 	b
2375	As wise, to mourn the seed which grew 	b
2376	Upon her dying mind, 	b
2377	Its gentle ray cannot control 	b
2378	It comes at last to cancel time, 	b
2379	Which since this morn laid many low ; 	b
2380	Around me, wretches uttering praise, 	b
2381	Or howling o'er their hopeless days, 	b
2382	It breathed from its heart invisible. 	b
2383	A brotherhood of misery, 	b
2384	That it quenches e'en now the vital spark, 	b
2385	Whose madness daily maddened me, 	b
2386	Arouse thee from thy dreams I 	b
2387	Escape earth's dungeon tomb ? 	b
2388	But only give me back my tears, 	b
2389	What seems the vilest, even like thine 	b
2390	As if to invite the smiling skies ; 	b
2391	Of seraph's song, and demon's moan ; 	b
2392	In concord with her reddening cheek. 	b
2393	As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering un- 	b
2394	And far away in woody dell 	b
2395	I stole away from crowds and light 	b
2396	There like a wild beast turns he back, 	b
2397	Lavished glory on that second May ! 	b
2398	The mortal strife that then befell ; 	b
2399	And yet a little longer speak, 	b
2400	4 Yet moved she not ; she only raised 	b
2401	An earnest grief a strong desire 	b
2402	The city's murmur softly blends 	b
2403	That we must long till life be done ; 	b
2404	As thick as morning's tears ; 	b
2405	That heaven which my sweet lover's brow 	b
2406	His frequent sighs, long-drawn and deep, 	b
2407	And Love I laugh to scorn ; 	b
2408	Could I have seen my country smile ? 	b
2409	A hundred fights for them ! 	b
2410	Little moss-rose, cease to weep, 	b
2411	Their cruel strife may close ; 	b
2412	Will tread its labyrinths alone. 	b
2413	Oh, thy sweet tongue must plead for me 	b
2414	Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 	b
2415	'Tis all that I implore ; 	b
2416	In life and death a chainless soul, 	b
2417	And oh ! above the best of those 	b
2418	If ranks beneath the cannon fall, 	b
2419	I repent not that which my hand has done 	b
2420	And I can sing and I can smile, 	b
2421	Alike, while I have holiday. 	b
2422	Where wilt thou go, my harassed heart 	b
2423	To aid a spirit lost in crime, 	b
2424	What spot, or near or far apart, 	b
2425	Lights me till my life is done ; 	b
2426	There is a spot, 'mid barren hills, 	b
2427	And high its arched windows rise, 	b
2428	The last full cup of triumph drink, 	b
2429	Nor yet the ocean's wave. 	b
2430	Bring good in rising, leave peace in decline, 	b
2431	Sighed at first, but sighed not long ; 	b
2432	Grows as green in April rain, 	b
2433	One glance revealed how little care 	b
2434	The mute bird sitting on the stone, 	b
2435	I was not tired, my darling one, 	b
2436	I saw to-day my enemy. 	b
2437	For ever present to my eye, 	b
2438	My worn heart throbs so wildly 	b
2439	The alien firelight died away ; 	b
2440	And seen in mist and moonlit stone, 	b
2441	I am speaking of a later stroke, 	b
2442	But mine sank sad and low ! 	b
2443	And all do homage to their will, 	b
2444	A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain 	b
2445	And when I laughed they all replied ; 	b
2446	'Till the dread burst breaks forth once more 	b
2447	So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air ; 	b
2448	And as blithely as of yore 	b
2449	When the pen that motto drew. 	b
2450	But long lies the dew on its crimson leaves, 	b
2451	Up rose he, and stretched forth his hand, 	b
2452	And revelled in my changeful dreams, 	b
2453	Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep. 	b
2454	Of each dark night and dim, beclouded day. 	b
2455	I gazed within thine earnest eyes 	b
2456	Brought to earth the fluttering game : 	b
2457	Restraint and heavy task recoil. 	b
2458	The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more 	b
2459	Who spend too soon their youthful day. 	b
2460	The common paths that others run ; 	b
2461	That centre all the joys of years. 	b
2462	That waves in summer air : 	b
2463	Wears not a cloud that speaks of gloom. 	b
2464	To soothe my spirit's care. 	b
2465	From morning's faintest dawning 	b
2466	Begilt with tasselled cords of gold, 	b
2467	Wilt thou prove faithless now ? 	b
2468	I 'd fling the brand in the hissing sea, 	b
2469	So often to the unopened door? 	b
2470	Have sought one gleam of mercy there ! 	b
2471	Across the mountain stream. 	b
2472	A few years of captivity, 	b
2473	And ice upon the glancing stream 	b
2474	You 've tracked me to a lonely spot. 	b
2475	Earth's wilderness was round me spread, 	b
2476	And night obscure his way ; 	b
2477	Mysterious it rose from the billowy moor. 	b
2478	Because they have no stay but thine. 	b
2479	With thunder volleys rolling on before 	b
2480	The sting of anguish drear/ 	b
2481	Re-echo back again. 	b
2482	'Tis better far away ; 	b
2483	They who have been our life, our soul, 	b
2484	Geraldine, wilt thou delay? 	b
2485	For, oh ! when chill the sunbeams fall 	b
2486	My soul, another love. 	b
2487	Following the bend of Aspin's side, 	b
2488	But, if there be a God above, 	b
2489	The whole devoured and lost in death ! 	b
2490	Ere evening far away. 	b
2491	I could think in the withered grass 	b
2492	The loving spirit lingers long, 	b
2493	I turned me from that young saint's bed 	b
2494	Through th' autumnal sky ; 	b
2495	I watch this cloudy evening fall, 	b
2496	For whom his spirit unforgiven 	b
2497	Sweet voices in the halls resound, 	b
2498	Did my exiled spirit grieve. 	b
2499	O no, it was not this ! 	b
2500	'Tis the last line of the woeful song ; 	b
2501	My tortured limbs in dungeons bind, 	b
2502	' It was spring, and the skylark was singing * ; 	b
2503	With a solemn, plaintive sound. 	b
2504	And waken unavailing tears. 	b
2505	Nor absence, nor distance can quell. 	b
2506	And lonely I am pining, 	b
2507	They uttered the music of May ; 	b
2508	Far less when evening's pensive hour 	b
2509	To that deep and swelling river 	b
2510	While thy heart suffers there. 	b
2511	And there were garments spread, 	b
2512	No ten can deal such deadly misery 	b
2513	To walk by the hill-torrent's side ! 	b
2514	It is swelled with the first snowy weather ; 	b
2515	The rocks they are icy and hoar, 	b
2516	Arthur, brother, we returned 	b
2517	Fierce grew Rosina's gloomy gaze ; 	b
2518	There are no yellow stars on the mountain ; 	b
2519	'Tis here 'tis there, 'tis nowhere oh ! my soul, 	b
2520	Gaze not so earnestly upon 	b
2521	Leagues on leagues are left behind 	b
2522	But lovelier than corn-fields all waving 	b
2523	All thy cold and scornful pride, 	b
2524	My spirit drank a mingled tone, 	b
2525	I would have dreary weather, 	b
2526	'Tis thus that human minds will turn, 	b
2527	And envied such despair. 	b
2528	I paused, confounded and distracted, 	b
2529	A lip of cruel scorn ; 	b
2530	To where those signal lights are burning, 	b
2531	And swift were the wings to our feet given, 	b
2532	Their brows are unshadowed, undimmed by woe. 	b
2533	What sudden power the fancy hath 	b
2534	That vision of a mighty host 	b
2535	And this shall be my dream to-night ; 	b
2536	I shall be a dream to thee. 	b
2537	For the moors, where the linnet was trilling 	b
2538	My present entity ! 	b
2539	Within itself may tell ! 	b
2540	And fair it budded day by day 	b
2541	His features in the wave. 	b
2542	Yawned in the city's reeling wall, 	b
2543	On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling, 	b
2544	In my Redeemer's name 	b
2545	And proud its mighty columns show 	b
2546	It feels no sympathy 	b
2547	I hurried down the dark oak stair ; 	b
2548	When I was hardly six years old, 	b
2549	But not the loved music, whose waking 	b
2550	No fear of grief in her bright eyes should quiver ; 	b
2551	In frozen mist arrayed. 	b
2552	Sweet land of light ! Thy children fair 	b
2553	A mutual immortality. 	b
2554	And sprang up to a glorious birth 	b
2555	Needst thou then dissemble sorrow, 	b
2556	Those tears had been heaven to me. 	b
2557	Well well ; the sad minutes are moving, 	b
2558	Though loaded with trouble and pain ; 	b
2559	And some time the loved and the loving 	b
2560	Shall meet on the mountains again I 	b
2561	How could I ask for pitying love, 	b
2562	Thus to the man of sin he spoke : 	b
2563	ward votary, and to recall within his influence the proud mind 	b
2564	And murmur, summer-streams 	b
2565	Some nameless thing which hid not grace, 	b
2566	She strikes it off with little care ; 	b
2567	Shall nature cease to bow ? 	b
2568	From such a lethargy ? 	b
2569	Whose streets stretch round so ceaselessly. 	b
2570	O do not think that God can leave, 	b
2571	Subdued both grief and passion wild. 	b
2572	Loud was the sudden gust of woe 	b
2573	A burdened heart I bear, 	b
2574	' Because, I hoped while they enjoyed, 	b
2575	This shadow should night's welcome be ; 	b
2576	When wounded he wins to the darkest wood, 	b
2577	Sinks from the summer sky, 	b
2578	To watch through all eternity, 	b
2579	And then a captive's tomb. 	b
2580	My ear drank his dying sigh. 	b
2581	But check those coward sobs, and bring 	b
2582	And keep it still divine 	b
2583	Though burning thoughts that spurn control, 	b
2584	That thy dear blood was poured in vain.' 	b
2585	Then art thou not my golden June, 	b
2586	Yet few would ask a heaven 	b
2587	More like this earth than thine. 	b
2588	Then let my winds caress thee ; 	b
2589	But what will winter bring? 	b
2590	Must first be utterly forgot. 	b
2591	And earthly change from pain to pain, 	b
2592	HERE again is the same mind in converse with a like 	b
2593	Rank, beauty, wealth, and power combine 	b
2594	Halos ! O far too bright to shine 	b
2595	The opening sea seemed smooth at last ; 	b
2596	A cloudless moon shone through 	b
2597	* Nay, rather, Gondal's shaken throne 	b
2598	* Douglas, he pleaded bitterly, 	b
2599	I need not sink beneath my woes ; 	b
2600	And yet, through every magic change, 	b
2601	The young and aged tree, 	b
2602	Her forehead, drooped like lily pale. 	b
2603	I needed not its breathing 	b
2604	Her children are rank and her kingdom's spread far. 	b
2605	For him no tear his stern eye shed 	b
2606	How dark the woods will be ! 	b
2607	4 The thick leaves in my murmur 	b
2608	It breaks upon the awful roar 	b
2609	The time of grace is past, 	b
2610	' Well, since it must be told, Lady, 	b
2611	Thy perished faith shall spring to life, 	b
2612	The ringlets of his long black hair 	b
2613	Over the Eden of his soul ; 	b
2614	Love, and its own life, had power to keep it 	b
2615	All round the hot and glaring sky 	b
2616	That dearest boon was given ; 	b
2617	In their own course to flow.' 	b
2618	Evince my gratitude ! 	b
2619	Oh no ; these brighter visions vast 	b
2620	IN MEMORY OF 	b
2621	' 1 '11 win thee 'gainst thy will. 	b
2622	Ere his quivering limbs, all foam-flecked, 	b
2623	They say, ' Zalona celebrates 	b
2624	For Nature's sad reality, 	b
2625	And on its green bank, bathed in gore, 	b
2626	Have slaves subdued the free? 	b
2627	Beneath the church-aisle stone, 	b
2628	And Truth may rudely trample down 	b
2629	And thou for being alone.' 	b
2630	lut dreary, strange, and pale and cold. 	b
2631	It tumbled in an inky sea. 	b
2632	which it is stayed. 	b
2633	' AYE there it is ! it wakes to-night 	b
2634	Deep feelings I thought dead ; 	b
2635	That lulling monotone did sing 	b
2636	To cover deeds untrue, 	b
2637	My lonely years had known. 	b
2638	And by thine eyes' full gaze, 	b
2639	And by the words thou scarce dost speak, 	b
2640	The anguish in my breast, 	b
2641	Besides the mist is half withdrawn, 	b
2642	The moon of summer pours 	b
2643	I weary for that land divine, 	b
2644	O'er each familiar tower. 	b
2645	1 It is hope's spell that glorifies, 	b
2646	That welled from mortal grief, I knew 	b
2647	I HAVE gone backward in the work, 	b
2648	The whisper of its fall : 	b
2649	But those were in the early glow 	b
2650	From thine own influence free ; 	b
2651	That clay he feels will not for ever 	b
2652	Come, leave thy dwelling dark and cold, 	b
2653	1 Thus truly, when that breast is cold, 	b
2654	Thy prisoned soul shall rise ; 	b
2655	The dungeon mingle with the mould 	b
2656	Dire region of most mighty woe, 	b
2657	And is her mirror broke at last 	b
2658	Quietly fed in grassy dells ; 	b
2659	One glimpse of that unearthly form 	b
2660	It treads a forest wide, 	b
2661	The ardent, and the happy breast, 	b
2662	The sullen clouds lay all unbroken 	b
2663	And though its wind repining grieved, 	b
2664	For ever on my heart ! 	b
2665	The holly is dark when the rose-brier blooms, 	b
2666	Hopes quenched, and rising thoughts subdued, 	b
2667	* And hope can hardly deck the cheek 	b
2668	And in the zenith of his fame 	b
2669	And just like his its ringlets bright, 	b
2670	Oppressive mystery hung ; 	b
2671	Though wasted sore with sorrow, 	b
2672	What do these brazen tongues proclaim ? 	b
2673	One task alone remains thy pictured face to view, 	b
2674	THE ELDER'S REBUKE 	b
2675	For nothing nearer paradise 	b
2676	Yes, by the tears I Ve poured, 	b
2677	Kneeling on the blood-stained heath 	b
2678	Watch life's bubbles float away : 	b
2679	To rouse its flickering radiance higher ; 	b
2680	Comes on the increasing roar ! 	b
2681	Oh, in the days of ardent youth 	b
2682	Their dark, their deadly ray would more than 	b
2683	Where that perished sapling used to be ; 	b
2684	Remembrance of his early home 	b
2685	Pondered and approved at last : 	b
2686	Thank the power that banished thee ; 	b
2687	* Glorious is the prize of Duty, 	b
2688	Are quenched in morning dull and grey? 	b
2689	Thy comrades to the camp retire ; 	b
2690	Rests such a shade of deep despair, 	b
2691	Youth's early sunshine was poured on his 	b
2692	She sat without the grated den, 	b
2693	A winter's night. 	b
2694	Heedless feet to gulfs of crime. 	b
2695	For those whose bodies rest in sleep, 	b
2696	That from which it sprung Eternity. 	b
2697	When stealing on to lady's bower, 	b
2698	With looks and smiles divine ! 	b
2699	Far down from heaven its silver flood 	b
2700	That wherever I wander, my heart is with thee. 	b
2701	4 The lays I love so well.' 	b
2702	Virtue is not won by fears.' 	b
2703	Thoughts shut within the silent tomb, 	b
2704	So would I fearful vigil keep, 	b
2705	To send to hell my mortal foe. 	b
2706	Walked by the lightsome touch of pleasure : 	b
2707	Had he ne'er met a gentler teacher, 	b
2708	I saw the burning sunshine fall, 	b
2709	In his most burning mood ; 	b
2710	Heavy and dull as lead. 	b
2711	Might haply dawn above ; 	b
2712	Brenzaida's crest is down ; 	b
2713	To leave its clay a little while, 	b
2714	Can take the bliss that has been given, 	b
2715	True to myself, and true to all, 	b
2716	It was not hope that wrecked at once 	b
2717	That never would cloud the world of day. 	b
2718	The cold corpse from its funeral pall, 	b
2719	A glorious child again ; 	b
2720	And draw his tired gaze from futurity ? 	b
2721	And black the piles of rain-clouds lour 	b
2722	That glory-shedding star shall glow 	b
2723	Where sinless sunshine lay : 	b
2724	So softly evening blends with night, 	b
2725	And seek a rough and lonely way ; 	b
2726	First melted off the hope of youth, 	b
2727	Nor mirth, nor music wakes my halls. 	b
2728	They whispered nought, but, ' Lady, sleep, 	b
2729	When it bears my slumbering child. 	b
2730	Strikes the strings resistlesslyt 	b
2731	The deep-down sea with sudden sound 	b
2732	Calm this resentful mood ; 	b
2733	Darkening all my summer skies, 	b
2734	For well he knew what dangers frowned, 	b
2735	All full of God thy features shine. 	b
2736	The glad birds carolled clear ; 	b
2737	Between his port and him. 	b
2738	My name is on a million tongues, 	b
2739	And nothing but that agony 	b
2740	In daisied lawns sleep peacefully, 	b
2741	And solemn, soothing, softened airs, 	b
2742	* Others have been thou mayst be there. ' 	b
2743	Incline thee to my changeful will, 	b
2744	Thank the power that made thee part 	b
2745	Because I could not save. 	b
2746	It recks not now, when all is over : 	b
2747	The woodland park around it spread, 	b
2748	A mourner still, though friend and lover 	b
2749	And there it lightens ! Dashed with gore 	b
2750	We would not leave our nature home 	b
2751	As if through all the 'wildering maze 	b
2752	Time parts the heart of men. 	b
2753	' Dearest, ever deem me true ' ; 	b
2754	And makes the shout of victory 	b
2755	Remoter still am I from Thee j 	b
2756	And on a strange road journeyed on, 	b
2757	might my eyes with tears run o'er ! 	b
2758	And makes me strong to undergo 	b
2759	But cold cold is that resting-place, 	b
2760	Saw those tokens on the ground. 	b
2761	And dear to me, aye doubly dear, 	b
2762	O'er bower and trees that orb divine 	b
2763	Thy eternal Justice found ! 	b
2764	And sworn friends fall from me : 	b
2765	A memory whose blighting beam 	b
2766	The fate was cruel which bore 	b
2767	To see her cheek's returning glow ; 	b
2768	I saw her stand in the gallery long, 	b
2769	Sleep on ; Heaven laughs above, 	b
2770	A noble victory you shall sing 	b
2771	He almost deemed, might have throbbed again 	b
2772	Part human company ; 	b
2773	And render up life's tiresome load. 	b
2774	That by the death of my dearest treasures 	b
2775	Through the wan autumnal sky ; 	b
2776	I saw his hoof-prints mark the rock, 	b
2777	But this shall be the only time 	b
2778	I can tear my soul from its mould of clay, 	b
2779	Hush its whispers in your breast ; 	b
2780	1 should be where I wish to be. 	b
2781	Crushed helpless into earth and Dust ! 	b
2782	Full many an eye watched over me, 	b
2783	Does sudden silence chill the room ? 	b
2784	My whole heart centred there ; 	b
2785	If you forget the sacred vows 	b
2786	Then let me not despair ; 	b
2787	Such as their lips could only pour, 	b
2788	Beneath whose noble dome 	b
2789	Have anchored safe, and rest at last 	b
2790	His dark, keen eyes on Percy gaze 	b
2791	Gone ! 'tis a word which through life's troubled 	b
2792	Say how long my sleep has been ? 	b
2793	Has warmed and blest me long : 	b
2794	Would bring its after-storm of pain. 	b
2795	Shall set my spirit free, 	b
2796	And nerved, like mine, to kill ; 	b
2797	The elm-tree by the haunted well 	b
2798	THE LADY TO HER GUITAR 	b
2799	And green light slept on the happy earth, 	b
2800	I know our souls are all divine, 	b
2801	To wander far away ; 	b
2802	It is stilled above the slain. 	b
2803	Sighing, mourning ever more. 	b
2804	And his fiery heart aroused panting. 	b
2805	Nor hurt thy soul eternally. 	b
2806	Resounded far and near : 	b
2807	These ceaseless tears ! I wish their flow 	b
2808	This voice, though never heard before, 	b
2809	How little fraught with real ill, 	b
2810	And we together sadly sank 	b
2811	The earth as golden, green, and fair, 	b
2812	What joyous fete begun, 	b
2813	And cheerfully go out to play. 	b
2814	HEAVY hangs the rain-drop 	b
2815	Pours black reproach on^me : 	b
2816	Exhaust thy life and hold thee here. 	b
2817	The reckless man would pray ; 	b
2818	Of his unquenched, unclouded blaze, 	b
2819	* Her heart is beating,' Lesley said, 	b
2820	And heavy throbs the young heart 	b
2821	And then I go to prove if God, at least, be true ! 	b
2822	O'er wood and wold o'er flood and fell, 	b
2823	The choking sob, the tortured moan. 	b
2824	I need not yield to care, 	b
2825	So lost that not a gleam may come. 	b
2826	Frowning on the infant, 	b
2827	Whose windows looked on the minster-yard, 	b
2828	A bleak November's calm. 	b
2829	That melancholy boy. 	b
2830	GODS of the old mythology 	b
2831	The stranger would not turn away, 	b
2832	Long ere the poison-tainted air 	b
2833	Chasing angry thought away. 	b
2834	Where thou dost stand an hour ago, 	b
2835	A deeper cup of bitterer pain ; 	b
2836	On golden summer's forests green, 	b
2837	'Twas grief enough to think mankind 	b
2838	It might not be so drear, 	b
2839	Has never wooed to blow, 	b
2840	Scentless are thy petals, 	b
2841	Can watch the lustre leave its skies 	b
2842	The cannon with unceasing crash 	b
2843	Not one voice sobs * farewell ' ; 	b
2844	Barren is thy beauty, 	b
2845	So heaven's sun shines in thee. 	b
2846	Forget, forsake, refuse to hear ! 	b
2847	You both were vainly given : 	b
2848	I saw the light decay. 	b
2849	YET o'er his face a solemn light 	b
2850	Stanzas 5 and 6 have been crossed out in the manuscript. 	b
2851	From trampling on thy buried breast. 	b
2852	And bounding down the marble stair. 	b
2853	That none can pass again. 	b
2854	His banners all bravely flying ; 	b
2855	And cheered his host by adding stern 	b
2856	Why, Seraph, has thine erring wing 	b
2857	Wafted thee down to weep with him ? 	b
2858	IT *s over now ; I Ve known it all ; 	b
2859	Nor do I come to mingle tears ; 	b
2860	But sweet is day, though with shadows 	b
2861	To feel the frost-wind blow ! 	b
2862	Yet the grass before the door 	b
2863	But never more look up and see 	b
2864	Her darling child from her embrace 	b
2865	Will then like virtues shine ; 	b
2866	* Heavy and dark the night is closing ; 	b
2867	Heavy and dark may its bidding be : 	b
2868	May I never tread the hills again. 	b
2869	Or how in exile misery 	b
2870	' Watch in love by a fevered pillow, 	b
2871	When heaven repels my prayer, 	b
2872	Safe as the petrel on tossing billow, 	b
2873	Like summer's sunshine o'er a hill, 	b
2874	( Guardian-angel he lacks no longer ; 	b
2875	From his last hopeless agony, 	b
2876	Eclipsed the glory of the sky, 	b
2877	And my love is truer than angel-care.' 	b
2878	And all the joyous music breathing by, 	b
2879	The place, the hour the same ; 	b
2880	How canst thou linger now ? 	b
2881	And stars were in the depth of blue, 	b
2882	'Tis true she stands among the crowd, 	b
2883	Even so, Guitar, thy magic tone 	b
2884	The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot 	b
2885	And wept above thy fate the more 	b
2886	Flung streaks of moonshine here and there. 	b
2887	Your eyelids droop, a weight is on your brow ; 	b
2888	Woe to the gifted, crime to the giver, 	b
2889	And singing birds and sighing trees, 	b
2890	And dim the hearts that slowly die. 	b
2891	Spent in her Eden Isle 	b
2892	Passed with the ray whose shine it caught ; 	b
2893	What loves me, no word of mine shall e'er betray, 	b
2894	When, severed wide by guiltless gore, 	b
2895	And all their myriad voices 	b
2896	I heard it then, you heard it too, 	b
2897	He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me ; 	b
2898	Strange Power ! I trust thy might ; trust thou my 	b
2899	Looks from its golden frame ; 	b
2900	And that wide west has waked a word 	b
2901	But listen ! The earth is our campaign of war, 	b
2902	Whose sombre portal hides the light, 	b
2903	Clings Percy's wounded spirit so : 	b
2904	I shall not tread again the deep glens where it 	b
2905	The narrow dungeon of the dead, 	b
2906	A silence settled on the room, 	b
2907	Across the waters of despair 	b
2908	And quench the lamp and stir the fire, 	b
2909	Nor, through long hours of future pain, 	b
2910	Her kind face o'er thee shine ? 	b
2911	Have wrapt the parent orb away. 	b
2912	And give me liberty ! ' 	b
2913	Greets no returning summer skies ; 	b
2914	But yet faint not, mournful man ; 	b
2915	And from that world of heavenly light 	b
2916	To guide us in our lifetime's night, 	b
2917	Drowsy and dark my spirit lies, 	b
2918	But, ere night darkened down 	b
2919	Thou wert so bright and fair, 	b
2920	Yet could I with past pleasures 	b
2921	With blue and ghostly gleams, 	b
2922	Remorse even now may wake within 	b
2923	' Well there is rest there, 	b
2924	For there are angels weeping ; 	b
2925	The streets are crowded all, 	b
2926	Our children felt their fathers' wretchedness ; 	b
2927	Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear ; 	b
2928	And curb my own wild will. 	b
2929	True heart and brow unmarked by time, 	b
2930	The law that bade it not defy. 	b
2931	And called on Heaven to aid 	b
2932	With such a fervent zeal, 	b
2933	The clouded forms of long-past history. 	b
2934	It always walks with head declined, 	b
2935	It vexes me to choose another guide : 	b
2936	Their breasts have burst through the battle's 	b
2937	Their ghostly fingers flecked with snow, 	b
2938	What have those lonely mountains worth reveal- 	b
2939	But a wild bird sprang from his hidden lair, 	b
2940	The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling 	b
2941	Though time should change my youthful face, 	b
2942	THE following are the last lines my sister Emily ever wrote. 	b
2943	No coward soul is mine, 	b
2944	AND like myself lone, wholly lone, 	b
2945	I see Heaven's glories shine, 	b
2946	He hears the stream its waters fling ; 	b
2947	I 'M standing in the forest now, 	b
2948	Almighty, ever-present Deity ! 	b
2949	But a brave heart, with a tarnished name, 	b
2950	The splendour of the main, 	b
2951	They did not dare to smile. 	b
2952	That move men's hearts : unutterably vain ; 	b
2953	With windows yawning on intenser gloom, 	b
2954	When thy stream was troubled, did mine calmly 	b
2955	The wind blew fresh and free. 	b
2956	And forms and faces lost for ever 	b
2957	A thousand dreams of mind. 	b
2958	The steadfast rock of immortality. 	b
2959	Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock, 	b
2960	MILD the mist upon the hill, 	b
2961	Pervades and broods above, 	b
2962	Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears. 	b
2963	Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh ; 	b
2964	They kindled the perishing ember 	b
2965	And Thou were left alone, 	b
2966	That love, which will the wicked greet 	b
2967	The oath within that caverned hall, 	b
2968	And from the midst of cheerless gloom, 	b
2969	One calm hour on the brink of life 	b
2970	With thy mind's vision pierce the deep, 	b
2971	Eternal midnight there. 	b
2972	OPPRESSED with sin and woe, 	b
2973	And madness cannot feel thy scorn, 	b
2974	I longed to view that bliss divine 	b
2975	And often when the sun declines 	b
2976	The ghastly night, the ghastlier morrow, 	b
2977	Her wavy hair on her shoulders bare, 	b
2978	The burning tears that would keep welling, 	b
2979	That stains our standard green ? 	b
2980	Living in the depth of Heaven ; 	b
2981	As if each gasp were life expelling, 	b
2982	Like sudden ghosts, to memory came 	b
2983	'Tis nothing to eternity : 	b
2984	Mighty heaven, a glad avenger 	b
2985	Death comes on every wind. 	b
2986	That would not mourn the dead. 	b
2987	Thickening above me evermore. 	b
2988	Has neared its final close, 	b
2989	No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn ; 	b
2990	But mutely trace its airy way, 	b
2991	At last refused to mourn. 	b
2992	And summer days again begin 	b
2993	Changing, and still the same, yet swiftly passing. 	b
2994	The wild wind from that wavy main 	b
2995	I never thought to see again. 	b
2996	Bless thee, bright Sea, and glorious dome, 	b
2997	And thinks he of Patrician pride, 	b
2998	My voice is choked, but not with grief, 	b
2999	Bright, but yet sullied, love which could never 	b
3000	I know my mountain breezes 	b
3001	Deepened the gloom of evening's sky, 	b
3002	And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold 	b
3003	The long grass bending where I lay, 	b
3004	And in the heath or mountain far 	b
3005	The goats fly by with timid cry, 	b
3006	His golden days left long behind. 	b
3007	But then it was a calmer woe, 	b
3008	'Tis many a year, 'tis long ago, 	b
3009	A dream of what had been before j 	b
3010	Was that in which the summer sheen 	b
3011	Ungoverned nature madly spurned 	b
3012	Memory of feelings past, 	b
3013	Often I 've sat down on the ground, 	b
3014	Gazing up to the flush scarce seen, 	b
3015	Those bounding breasts that grief should thrill 	b
3016	Then died away, nor came again ; 	b
3017	Thy deep, unutterable woe? 	b
3018	But my sad heart must ever mourn 	b
3019	It sought thy father's home and mine 	b
3020	As I remembered it of old. 	b
3021	And dreamy scents of fragrance pass 	b
3022	Come back the feelings that would swell, 	b
3023	FAR away is the land of rest 	b
3024	They would have done it had they known 	b
3025	Oh ! I shall weary for the light 	b
3026	I howled, and tore my tangled hair ; 	b
3027	Time has turned the bloom to grey, 	b
3028	Lay in unspeakable despair. 	b
3029	of New York in 1902. 	b
3030	Then 'twas first my nursling smiled ; 	b
3031	But both without a murmur there 	b
3032	But her father smiled on the fairest child 	b
3033	WHAT winter floods, what streams of spring 	b
3034	winds coldly mourn 	b
3035	Dead, dead is my joy, 	b
3036	Might embrace in love again ; 	b
3037	To see that water shine ; 	b
3038	But sighing it murmurs, * Let memory perish, 	b
3039	IN the same place, when nature wore 	b
3040	And nothing on the summer gale 	b
3041	The dearest to a mountaineer 	b
3042	For, if your former words were true, 	b
3043	I cannot say my faith is strong, 	b
3044	Now might we doubt God's guardian 	b
3045	Those wondrous southern Isles to hail, 	b
3046	Behold he sinks away ! 	b
3047	LORD of Elbe, on Elbe hill 	b
3048	The mist is thick and the wind is chill ; 	b
3049	More wakeful heart and eyelids grew. 	b
3050	Has sighed for sorrow that thou wert away. 	b
3051	And in his hair the south wind blows, 	b
3052	And hopeless comes its dark decline, 	b
3053	Oh, we are listening for a sound, 	b
3054	Moans as the night gusts over it blow. 	b
3055	Till each far-down reflection is 	b
3056	I see them far off, and it deepens the gloom ; 	b
3057	An undefined, an awful dream, 	b
3058	Where chill, chill whiteness covered all, 	b
3059	In unexhausted woe. 	b
3060	In darkness long concealed, 	b
3061	Would now be tossing under me. 	b
3062	I will not question, only say 	b
3063	But thou art now on the desolate sea, 	b
3064	Regive him shadowy gleams of infancy 	b
3065	Of love too warm, and wild, and bright. 	b
3066	The Herons are flown to their trees by the Hall ; 	b
3067	COLD, clear, and blue the morning heaven 	b
3068	Will give me to a darker doom ; 	b
3069	Through a sky of cloudy grey. 	b
3070	Reflects that winter sky : 	b
3071	In glimpses of a spirit shore 	b
3072	A silent, silvery star. 	b
3073	And I have long forgot to weep. 	b
3074	Sweetly has its dawn begun ; 	b
3075	But the heaven may shake with thunder 	b
3076	Himself restored to infancy? 	b
3077	To leave my lonely halls ! ' 	b
3078	Bless thee, bless all I cannot speak ; 	b
3079	For the moon now beaming mild above 	b
3080	Go, shed thy tears in Ocean's wave 	b
3081	From that wide heaven where every star 	b
3082	IF grief for grief can touch thee, 	b
3083	One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings 	b
3084	Within their perfumed bower, 	b
3085	Of sorrows gathering near, 	b
3086	From her stately form and her features rare, 	b
3087	And young leaves shoot among the fern. 	b
3088	The twilight fading from the skies, 	b
3089	What ! shall they carve on his tomb with the sword 	b
3090	How thou didst turn in mockery 	b
3091	Sparkling in sunshine and in dew, 	b
3092	Had its waters worn the shore. 	b
3093	Methinks the mellowing haze of years 	b
3094	No doubt had marr'd my word ; 	b
3095	TELL me, tell me, smiling child, 	b
3096	What the past is like to thee? 	b
3097	As glancing o'er the moorland track, 	b
3098	Something in that ancestral pride 	b
3099	Tell me what is the present hour? 	b
3100	A green and flowery spray, 	b
3101	Where a young bird sits gathering its power 	b
3102	Your cold hands hardly hold the weary pen : 	b
3103	And what is the future, happy one? 	b
3104	Sunk to peace the twilight breeze : 	b
3105	A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea, 	b
3106	Stretching into infinity. 	b
3107	The inspiring music's thrilling sound, 	b
3108	No, Earth would wish no other sphere 	b
3109	The glittering splendour rising round, 	b
3110	Yet of the native shepherds none, 	b
3111	So stilly round the evening falls ; 	b
3112	To keep my honour fair ; 	b
3113	Covering her brow to hide the tear 	b
3114	The shepherd placed a seat and pressed 	b
3115	From it the torrents flow ? 	b
3116	Never put back that golden flow 	b
3117	That murmur to the breezes' call 	b
3118	The laden bee flew home, 	b
3119	And raised the covering from his brow, 	b
3120	* Nay, call me not ; it may not be ; 	b
3121	Still spoke to me of years gone by ; 	b
3122	Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending ; 	b
3123	Man's spirit away from the drear dungeon sending, 	b
3124	And sound and sight had well combined 	b
3125	All down the mountain-sides wild forests lending 	b
3126	The mighty voice to the life-giving wind ; 	b
3127	With dying torments riven 	b
3128	Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending, 	b
3129	The withering corpse to me. 	b
3130	The busy day has glided by, 	b
3131	For not through age, and not through crime, 	b
3132	Of the golden-gifted time ; 	b
3133	And, Douglas ! thou shalt be 	b
3134	When my sad soul forgot its pride 	b
3135	Since cast from off thine angel brow 	b
3136	Woods, you need not frown on me ; 	b
3137	I have suffered on thro' night and day ; 	b
3138	To know where she is laid. 	b
3139	You need not mock so bitterly. 	b
3140	Thy silvery form, so soft and fair, 	b
3141	I watched how evening took the place 	b
3142	And, far away, down Elmor scars 	b
3143	* The birds that now so blithely sing, 	b
3144	And warms the breezy air. 	b
3145	The waste of youth, the waste of years, 	b
3146	COME walk with me, 	b
3147	And still the words and still the tone 	b
3148	I dream of moor, and misty hill, 	b
3149	In all the hours of gloom 	b
3150	Will find a heart to bear. 	b
3151	WELL narrower draw the circle round, 	b
3152	Laid low in dust their Dryad-hair. 	b
3153	Through the long nights of angry weather, 	b
3154	When parted ghosts might come, 	b
3155	Above their prisoned dust to grieve 	b
3156	Its twilight hours and evenings dark 	b
3157	Whose waves are foaming far and wide. 	b
3158	One gush of ardent prayer. 	b
3159	Forget the hopes of years : 	b
3160	With the radiant red of furnace flames 	b
3161	Senselessly has lain. 	b
3162	To the discord of lute-strings all unstrung. 	b
3163	My robes, and smooth my tangled hair ; 	b
3164	And constant sorrow on my brow 	b
3165	The saints shall shelter thee from harm. 	b
3166	And spread with smiles the evening meal ; 	b
3167	In years by time long left behind ; 	b
3168	TO A WREATH OF SNOW 	b
3169	When I began to pray. 	b
3170	And still it bent above, 	b
3171	They come sailing on, 	b
3172	How oft have I forgot my God, 	b
3173	Yet my heart loves December's smile 	b
3174	That tracks the boundless blue. 	b
3175	Paints her image on the mind. 	b
3176	Of gazing in thine eyes. 	b
3177	And think the fearful vision o'er. 	b
3178	The blossoms to deck my home with the dead. 	b
3179	Tis like the heaven which parting days 	b
3180	The idol chiefs of all. 	b
3181	As if grown weary of the light 	b
3182	When its lips opened and a sound 	b
3183	Awoke the stillness reigning round, 	b
3184	Faint as a dream, but the earth shrank, 	b
3185	And truly like a god she seems, 	b
3186	Woe for the day ! Regina's pride, 	b
3187	Retracing back her lifetime flown ; 	b
3188	And thus in strange response he spoke. 	b
3189	The circling hills to kiss. 	b
3190	Where fairer forms in darkness lie ; 	b
3191	That time is treasuring up for me. 	b
3192	Sound through the granite glen ; 	b
3193	All vague and undefined ? 	b
3194	That sad lament was ringing ; 	b
3195	Twill break for thee. 	b
3196	Such dreamy, dreary singing. 	b
3197	Aware her last hour approaching fast, 	b
3198	Of mirror broken on the grass, 	b
3199	Watch for a bird with sable wing, 	b
3200	And weaker minds would fear. 	b
3201	I listened to thy mournful sighing. 	b
3202	Were by a faint breeze blown ; 	b
3203	I knew the source whence sprung those tears 	b
3204	They raise their eyes, for the sunny skies 	b
3205	Reveal ; where o'er a lone green wood 	b
3206	How well my spirit knows the path 	b
3207	Was given me in that silent hour 	b
3208	In a yeoman's home-close grew ; 	b
3209	In cell and cloister drear ; 	b
3210	At last the sunshine left the ground, 	b
3211	The bright blue flowers and velvet sod, 	b
3212	Were strange conductors to the bowers 	b
3213	I need not fear my foes, 	b
3214	Aid for that which lies before. 	b
3215	In a grave that never shuts its dead 	b
3216	Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface 	b
3217	In cloudy morning clothed the sky. 	b
3218	Come, sit down on this sunny stone ; 	b
3219	I saw His wisdom infinite, 	b
3220	In her uncovered eye ; 	b
3221	But beneath the earth is midnight 	b
3222	Waiting to hear the lingering feet 	b
3223	And whistles round the gloomy wall, 	b
3224	And lingering long, and thinking grieves, 	b
3225	How it longed how it burned to be free ! 	b
3226	And no one laughed, and none seemed free from 	b
3227	He wakens, and how ghastly white 	b
3228	By whom all things were made ; 	b
3229	So, resting on a heathy bank, 	b
3230	And will sustain when thou art gone. 	b
3231	me mourn ; 	b
3232	An anguish in his bosom now ; 	b
3233	COMPANIONS all day long we 've stood 	b
3234	Fixed strainedly on the vacant air ; 	b
3235	His wisdom so divine, 	b
3236	Weak, wretched sinner though I be, 	b
3237	Sleeping silently and still, 	b
3238	On Eversham's woody brow. 	b
3239	That living, is not nobler now 	b
3240	Too full to hide their tears, too stern to overflow ; 	b
3241	To see the sunshine disappear ; 	b
3242	The breeze sings like a summer breeze 	b
3243	Then silent weep J cannot weep, 	b
3244	Cut off from hope in early day, 	b
3245	From earth and glory cut away. 	b
3246	That haunts his feudal home ; 	b
3247	Must image forth the scowl of night, 	b
3248	And childhood's flower must waste its bloom 	b
3249	Beneath the shadow of the tomb. 	b
3250	Though vengeance held a sheathed sword 	b
3251	And still did evening fall ; 	b
3252	Through infinite immensity. 	b
3253	Wave gently round her head. 	b
3254	Tells what once those features were, 	b
3255	By that celestial shine I 	b
3256	And the dying their last watch were keeping 	b
3257	Let us be laid in lasting rest, 	b
3258	Lost their robes of tender green ? 	b
3259	That I should greet approaching feet, 	b
3260	Half the sweet, the haunting smile ; 	b
3261	Other desires and other hopes beset me, 	b
3262	There is a voice in the wind that waves 	b
3263	And pleasure tune its chords again. 	b
3264	And my eyes cannot hold the tears 	b
3265	Was it some feeling of delight, 	b
3266	From the time of morning's earliest dew 	b
3267	Blasts with that oath his perjured soul, 	b
3268	Kindle a short and bitter smile, 	b
3269	The sun of evening died, 	b
3270	Sleep, stilly sleep, thou bright-haired child, 	b
3271	Its large dark eyes of shadowy light, 	b
3272	Waveless and calm lies that silent deep 	b
3273	They fleck with shade our mountains bright 	b
3274	A little longer in this reverie : 	b
3275	Upon its heathy shores. 	b
3276	But not a dream of sleep ; 	b
3277	Ah ! could my hand unlock its chain, 	b
3278	Were off like light again. 	b
3279	For every torturing tear. 	b
3280	And chained was every tongue. 	b
3281	To mourn o'er what I mourn. 	b
3282	God ! bless her sun with victory, 	b
3283	In some warm nook a couch to find. 	b
3284	strong and far : 	b
3285	Fluttering from the autumn tree. 	b
3286	That through the shadows shone 	b
3287	The languid lid would close, 	b
3288	Though I no more may watchful bend 	b
3289	Through dreams where startling imagery 	b
3290	Can no memory now recall 	b
3291	Home to their journey's end ; 	b
3292	ALONE I sat ; the summer day 	b
3293	Had died in smiling light away ; 	b
3294	Returning to my breast again. 	b
3295	For past misery are we weeping? 	b
3296	I will sail the desert sea. 	b
3297	Roams in the dawn of day ; 	b
3298	The harvest-moon looks down ; 	b
3299	Look on those woods, look on that mountain lorn, 	b
3300	I '11 hide it in my heart no more, 	b
3301	Then why is all so sad and lone? 	b
3302	How invincible its roar, 	b
3303	A shattered wreck on ocean's tide, 	b
3304	But that at Ambition's bidding, 	b
3305	The heart so long endeared to thee, 	b
3306	Are you a hawk to follow the prey, 	b
3307	Till death shall sound his signal cry, 	b
3308	Visions by ardent fancy fed 	b
3309	And yet a dreamlike comfort came 	b
3310	But now, when I had hoped to sing, 	b
3311	My fingers strike a tuneless string ; 	b
3312	Who bound us in one vigorous whole 	b
3313	Still clung she to his bridle rein 	b
3314	Yet have I read these falcon eyes, 	b
3315	He faintly prayed, < O Death, delay 	b
3316	But a tyrant spell has bound me, 	b
3317	'Tis like old age pretending 	b
3318	Roofless, crumbling to the ground ; 	b
3319	Their bare boughs weighed with snow, 	b
3320	We both together struck the blow ; 	b
3321	And yet I cannot go. 	b
3322	OH, all the cares these noontide airs 	b
3323	Wastes beyond wastes below ; 	b
3324	When the sun first crowned the hill, 	b
3325	Beneath these sullen skies? 	b
3326	I 'LL come when thou art saddest, 	b
3327	Bring light to the darkened room, 	b
3328	When the rude day's mirth has vanished, 	b
3329	Spirit of bliss ! what brings thee here, 	b
3330	Long he gazed and held his breath, 	b
3331	I '11 come when the heart's worst feeling 	b
3332	Has entire, unbiassed sway, 	b
3333	But some I read so well, 	b
3334	And gives to fancy magic power 	b
3335	It was a summer day that saw 	b
3336	Listen ! 'tis just the hour, 	b
3337	But who reads not through the tender glow 	b
3338	But thank your passion not for me ! 	b
3339	A flood of strange sensations roll, 	b
3340	Forerunners of a sterner power, 	b
3341	Heralds of me? 	b
3342	THE soft unclouded blue of air, 	b
3343	Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke 	b
3344	How daredst thou wake thoughts in me, 	b
3345	And lived upon this weary Earth 	b
3346	But then I knew that he stood free, 	b
3347	Was it the smile of early spring 	b
3348	And then I felt . . . \unfinished\. 	b
3349	Now trust a heart that trusts in you, 	b
3350	Douglas leaned above the well ; 	b
3351	And may not be forgiven. 	b
3352	My heart is with your heart at home ; 	b
3353	cold, cold is my heart ! 	b
3354	We both were scorned, both sternly driven 	b
3355	Over his own unhappy soul ; 	b
3356	Unless I change in every thought, 	b
3357	And memory will restore me nought, 	b
3358	Look now she rests below, 	b
3359	The clouds are earthward yearning ; 	b
3360	The smothering snow-clouds rolled away ; 	b
3361	The barren mountain-side lies bare, 	b
3362	He would not give one moorland wild 	b
3363	As shines earth's sun in summer noon 	b
3364	And whiter brows than yours may be, 	b
3365	Where city walls spread wide around 	b
3366	And lightning looks from orbs divine 	b
3367	About my pathway burn and shine. 	b
3368	But that pure light, changeless and strong, 	b
3369	That last dim beam that sets for thee, 	b
3370	Echoing to their bells. 	b
3371	My feeble faith still clings to Thee. 	b
3372	When we were wont to burst away 	b
3373	Remembrance never dies, 	b
3374	From hope, and peace, and power, and 	b
3375	Her former life's eventful day 	b
3376	Know nought akin to our despair ; 	b
3377	Without a voice to speak to you 	b
3378	For that mist may break when the sun is high, 	b
3379	For bygone griefs and dried-up tears. 	b
3380	In open day and cheerful sun, 	b
3381	Lord Lesley, let it free ; 	b
3382	Waiting the death that was to come. 	b
3383	On which it ought to wend. 	b
3384	Sleep brings no strength to me, 	b
3385	Must claim from Justice lasting rest ; 	b
3386	Youth's warm affections gave, 	b
3387	To meet its early tomb ? 	b
3388	Mad though that anguish be, 	b
3389	As warm as middle June. 	b
3390	And yet it seems a dreary moor, 	b
3391	Was heavier far than earth can be ; 	b
3392	A shelter from the sky. 	b
3393	And never Fejian devotee 	b
3394	My only wish is to forget 	b
3395	In endless sleep of death. 	b
3396	Fireless hearths, and lifeless homes ; 	b
3397	Had they but seen their idol then, 	b
3398	Strong I stand, and laugh to see 	b
3399	That leaf from its parent tree ; 	b
3400	Shut out from joy and liberty, 	b
3401	All the puny ways of men ; 	b
3402	The first to fight, the last to fall, 	b
3403	Then come again ; thou wilt not shrink 	b
3404	The glory of the festal day, 	b
3405	Ought for a moment to be mine : 	b
3406	Affrightened from that ceaseless roar. 	b
3407	Beneath its mighty glare : 	b
3408	Thing of Dust, with boundless pride, 	b
3409	Dare you ask me for a guide ? 	b
3410	Will hardly let her gleam, 	b
3411	Or any, but an exile's doom. 	b
3412	Windows through whose broken panes the night- 	b
3413	To free the world from tyrant's chain, 	b
3414	For which we fought and bled and died. 	b
3415	I saw her give th' unanswered kiss 	b
3416	Full soon divided him from me. 	b
3417	Where their bright glories shone at first. 	b
3418	To shelter 'neath a foreign heaven ; 	b
3419	Till far beyond earth's frenzied strife, 	b
3420	That should startle the nations that rest around. 	b
3421	What pleasant airs upon her face 	b
3422	Confused and strange and drear. 	b
3423	She sits and fondly seems to trace 	b
3424	And never more at early dawning 	b
3425	And I must see the final gloom 	b
3426	The accursed man shall be ; 	b
3427	Dear childhood's innocence forgive, 	b
3428	And my eye can wander through worlds of light. 	b
3429	Methinks their chime sounds faint and drear, 	b
3430	My lids closed down, yet through their veil 	b
3431	The glory of a summer sky. 	b
3432	And form my mood to Nature's mood. 	b
3433	The tiny ripples flame. 	b
3434	Went, and ne'er returned again ! 	b
3435	I cannot bear to go away. 	b
3436	May beam the blaze of July's sun, 	b
3437	To soothe your grief or calm your care ; 	b
3438	Nay, do not weep ; that bitter mourning 	b
3439	And man's remarks or sighs or scorn, 	b
3440	Full many a heart, that in the tomb, 	b
3441	For ever dark, for ever cold. 	b
3442	You '11 dry your tears and check your sighing, 	b
3443	Lie low and lone the silent dead ; 	b
3444	FALL, leaves, fall ; die, flowers, away ; 	b
3445	If I were quite alone, 	b
3446	One ripple in the lovely lake ; 	b
3447	Lost, cursed, degraded all for thee ! 	b
3448	There are bones whitening there in the 	b
3449	Fernando left his home and you, 	b
3450	And still I think you must remember 	b
3451	Marking my despondency. 	b
3452	Lit by the evening flame, 	b
3453	I longed to see his face again, 	b
3454	From his daylong dream at once he woke ; 	b
3455	Better that I my own fate mourning, 	b
3456	Except for you, my dearest queen ! 	b
3457	There lies a lone and lovely glade, 	b
3458	And there the hearts together nourished, 	b
3459	Since parted from thee I am left alone, 	b
3460	The afternoon in softened glory 	b
3461	In the old church beneath the stone, 	b
3462	And the broad park spread before me 	b
3463	And curse instead of pray. 	b
3464	And there I stood when he had left me, 	b
3465	With ashy cheek and tearless eye, 	b
3466	Watching the ship whose sail bereft me 	b
3467	In gathering gloom in every glade, 	b
3468	By the wild storm blasts roughly broke, 	b
3469	O may I never lose the peace 	b
3470	My soul still bounded o'er the billow, 	b
3471	The curtains waved, the wakened flies 	b
3472	The azure flowers where they were nursed, 	b
3473	One brief glimpse to thine eye, I 	b
3474	Its much-desired repose. 	b
3475	Of safe deliverance from the sea. 	b
3476	Yet, alas ! the sooner turning 	b
3477	And drowned my bloom of youth in tears. 	b
3478	And time at length brought power for coping 	b
3479	With thoughts I could not once endure. 	b
3480	MAY flowers are opening, 	b
3481	The place that saw our last farewell, 	b
3482	Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe, 	b
3483	In plundered churches piled with dead 	b
3484	Go out upon the breezy moor ; 	b
3485	AWAKE, awake ! how loud the stormy morning 	b
3486	Calls up to life the nation's resting round ; 	b
3487	What follows in Ula's garden sweet 	b
3488	And violet and wild woodrose 	b
3489	One whisper, one sweet dream in him, 	b
3490	' Twill only yield another sight 	b
3491	That while the world was lost to her 	b
3492	A beam of glory there, 	b
3493	It was cultured by another hand, 	b
3494	A traitor's perjury. 	b
3495	And her look of Majesty. 	b
3496	The sea-green standard lies in dust beneath. 	b
3497	To which my own was given ; 	b
3498	Soldiers, preserve that glory bright and free ; 	b
3499	It was just the time of eve, 	b
3500	Let me remember half the woes 	b
3501	Are but the shattered glass 	b
3502	Can still the spirit's storm ; 	b
3503	While thou canst speak with such a tone ! 	b
3504	But how can I live lonely here? 	b
3505	From turret, tower and wall. 	b
3506	And prone to every sin ; 	b
3507	And in the haze of glorious light 	b
3508	I have sat lonely all the day, 	b
3509	In the pure light of childhood's morn, 	b
3510	Where blackbird and the throstle dwell ; 	b
3511	Save that deep gong which tolled my 	b
3512	A thousand strains of Music swell. 	b
3513	For God alone doth know how blessed 	b
3514	And every listener swears it true ; 	b
3515	And tell me, why such blessed sleep 	b
3516	Unlike the bloom I like to see. 	b
3517	So full of soul, so deeply sweet ; 	b
3518	The grave must close those limbs around, 	b
3519	The moonbeam and the storm, 	b
3520	While the wind is whispering only, 	b
3521	Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim. 	b
3522	How can I break these iron chains, 	b
3523	Are the hours to come, the joyless hours, 	b
3524	With beams of such impartial blaze, 	b
3525	It chained the snow-swollen streams no more. 	b
3526	And they will reach it soon. 	b
3527	And then a sudden flash of flame, 	b
3528	And leave my human feelings 	b
3529	Into my heart and anxious eye, 	b
3530	Then his eyes began to weary, 	b
3531	Amid the howling storm of war? 	b
3532	care and tears and pain. 	b
3533	But coldly breaks November's day ; 	b
3534	But hate eternally. 1 	b
3535	Eldenna's waves are rolling red, 	b
3536	Shade of history, I condemn 	b
3537	If my spirit's eye can see, 	b
3538	And deeper green is on the hill. 	b
3539	I looked out to see her there, 	b
3540	They all are held in me ; 	b
3541	And all seem glad their voice to hear ; 	b
3542	Wisdom, scorned, knows no relenting ; 	b
3543	A tear might flow, ay, many a tear, 	b
3544	And there in those wild bowers 	b
3545	No whisper, not to me ; 	b
3546	I could not sleep through that wild siege, 	b
3547	I know that I have done thee wrong, 	b
3548	And mourned a love for ever flown. 	b
3549	Sank back again to childhood's day ; 	b
3550	Its cheering smile to see, 	b
3551	That sin was purified by woe. 	b
3552	Your worlds of solemn light, again, 	b
3553	To us, in unimagined bloom, 	b
3554	And she springs up in haste to greet 	b
3555	And thou art near thy prime? 	b
3556	It was a pleasant April day 	b
3557	So I knew that he was dying 	b
3558	Watching the drizzly mist descend, 	b
3559	Descend like rain upon the heath. 	b
3560	Its deadly mist o'er joys and cares. 	b
3561	Held by the mountain men. 	b
3562	Like bandit-knife was hung. 	b
3563	And what shall change that angel brow, 	b
3564	To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region ; 	b
3565	Laid on the grass I lapsed away, 	b
3566	Blend with a song of troubled times. 	b
3567	To seize the falling rein. 	b
3568	Thus thy first hour's course shall be : 	b
3569	With voice subdued and steady look, 	b
3570	Spring grass grows green and fair ; 	b
3571	Call Death yes Death he is mine own, 	b
3572	To live in every sweetest thought ; 	b
3573	And sweeter than a flute's reply 	b
3574	Where royal corpses lay. 	b
3575	And there was eastern incense burnt, 	b
3576	For sun, before they close, 	b
3577	In mercy launch one arrow more ; 	b
3578	With sacred halos round it shed ? 	b
3579	But death has stolen our company, 	b
3580	And words upon the breezes hung. 	b
3581	Its sufferings and its tears. 	b
3582	' Bless it ! My gracious God ! ' I cried. 	b
3583	Welcome at last, though once so drear. 	b
3584	Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish 	b
3585	Shall our feet forget the way ? 	b
3586	Vainly would man divine or tell. 	b
3587	STRONG I stand, though I have borne 	b
3588	Look how in sable gloom 	b
3589	A darker wave. 	b
3590	Glows o'er the graves of Elrington, 	b
3591	It was about the middle night 	b
3592	So their fond hearts were free, 	b
3593	The shallow wrecks of memories 	b
3594	Looks down on the descending sun ; 	b
3595	Thou art my intimate delight, 	b
3596	Deep secrets of His Providence 	b
3597	It pines in cold captivity, 	b
3598	One penance tender tears. 	b
3599	HINDER me by no delay ! 	b
3600	He dared not say me nay the hinges harshly turn. 	b
3601	Yonder they stand and watch the waves 	b
3602	What have I now? The star that brightly 	b
3603	Dry thine eyes, too ; 'tis vain to keep 	b
3604	HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES 	b
3605	Now seems as nothing in the single cloud 	b
3606	That laid my best affections low, 	b
3607	That thou wouldst call to mind. 	b
3608	And yet, a king, though Prudence well 	b
3609	My horse had strayed, I cannot say ; 	b
3610	Zamorna is this nobly done, 	b
3611	But could the day seem dark to me 	b
3612	Those tones were softer than the moan 	b
3613	Has passed from summer's heaven divine, 	b
3614	I ask for nothing further here 	b
3615	From the side of the wintry brae. 	b
3616	I should not be if that were gone 	b
3617	YES, holy be thy resting-place 	b
3618	THROUGH the hours of yesternight 	b
3619	She murmured with a sigh. 	b
3620	And nations round are fearing, 	b
3621	So humbly by her side ; 	b
3622	That set on fire my heart, but froze upon my 	b
3623	An icy glory caught mine eye, 	b
3624	O come away ! The Norman door 	b
3625	And my glad heart bound wilder still. 	b
3626	From his heart's fountain swell, 	b
3627	My hour of rest had fleeted by, 	b
3628	Toss up the window's velvet veil, 	b
3629	What is past can hurt no more ; 	b
3630	To sit within this Norman door, 	b
3631	No : that I feel can never be ; 	b
3632	* Angora's hills have heard their tread, 	b
3633	* Well, thou hast fought for many a year, 	b
3634	Like youth, to my maturer eyes, 	b
3635	She sees us, sister, now ; 	b
3636	And I have sat and watched the trees, 	b
3637	Their glory-haloed crown to wear. 	b
3638	And merry words to whispers die, 	b
3639	Whose forms have troubled me, 	b
3640	The woods and fields and golden flowers 	b
3641	That we must bind thee down and clench thy 	b
3642	Is welcome as a friend ; 	b
3643	Though earth and man were gone, 	b
3644	False and foolish mortal know, 	b
3645	I 've trod a dark and frightful way. 	b
3646	As kindly as the good. 	b
3647	The pure blue heaven with clouds of gold ; 	b
3648	Though not for fear, though not for shame. 	b
3649	Which shapeless figures on each piece 	b
3650	Those eyes shall make my only day, 	b
3651	As long as thou, the solemn night, 	b
3652	My outward sense is gone, my inward essence 	b
3653	And the crags where I wandered of old. 	b
3654	Joins the mad world in all its scorn. 	b
3655	Bore his soul from earth away. 	b
3656	Then why lament that those we love 	b
3657	And wild birds bursting from their songless nest, 	b
3658	But yet it was a glorious sun, 	b
3659	When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes 	b
3660	What my soul bore, my soul alone 	b
3661	Have studied long their glance and feel 	b
3662	And all my prospect of relief 	b
3663	His heart is stirred through all its strings, 	b
3664	And then a wakening from above ; 	b
3665	As it tossed against the heaven, 	b
