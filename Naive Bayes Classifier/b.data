Has checked the outlaw's way ; 	b
Ah ! my dear father, tell me why ? 	b
But what shall brave the deep, deep waves 	b
And gives the waves a brighter blue, 	b
Stooped, and raised his languid head ; 	b
Subdue this quenchless will ! ' 	b
He felt for all the beauty there. 	b
Turn back, from that tempestuous surge, 	b
Before it fades away ! 	b
When winter winds were wild . 	b
Warm and bright on Arden's lake 	b
All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given, 	b
Who motionless is laid . . . 	b
Of southern waters breaking to the wind, 	b
And laughter sink into a sigh, 	b
Their sunlit isles of paradise, 	b
The vain man smile, the fool deride, 	b
4 This is my home where whirlwinds blow, 	b
1 'd call forth the glorious chorus again 	b
With blood on his hand that he wept to have shed ? 	b
The space between is all forgot, 	b
* But, I '11 not fear, I will not weep 	b
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night ; 	b
I have one rite a gentle kiss ; 	b
When those who were thy own compeers, 	b
All Nature's million mysteries, 	b
To reach, at last, the eternal home, 	b
Was flitting o'er me evermore. 	b
But something whispers to my mind, 	b
What though the stars and fair moonlight 	b
And who with unregretful eyes 	b
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell 	b
Opening its ports for me and mine ; 	b
Implored to change for senseless rest 	b
How still, how happy ! These are words 	b
And what is thine that it should prove 	b
And fresh winds shook the door ; 	b
That I shall greet them ne'er again ! ' 	b
Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain ; 	b
And conquered good and conquering ill 	b
Gladly to see his gory sun 	b
Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave- 	b
Is human love so true ? 	b
The strength of eyesight to restore 	b
My monarch died to rule for ever 	b
Unawed, the darkness of the grave ? 	b
Which wilder visions muster'd to my mind ; 	b
Clothe in blood its sovereign's prayer. 	b
Hark ! listen to the distant gun 	b
Yet vainly flowed the calmer wave 	b
None need point the princely victim, 	b
* And now, 'mid northern mountains lone 	b
Are warring night and day ; 	b
From those brown hills, have melted into spring : 	b
On the shady side reclined 	b
On antique roof and hoary tree, 	b
That flush of roseate light, 	b
None but me beheld him dying, 	b
No ; 'twas not the flowery plain : 	b
Has Almadore in battle bled ! 	b
The yells, the groans, the frenzied gladness, 	b
Their careless young eyes are closed in sleeping ; 	b
T' escape from labour's tyrant power 	b
November's gusts unheeded call ; 	b
Doth he not rather roam ? 	b
And glowed both roof and floor ; 	b
And not one of all my lays 	b
1 Ice has barred the Arctic waters, 	b
The future fills me with dismay ; 	b
Felt, but unseen, the damp dewdrops fall. 	b
From those eternal waves that surge below. 	b
Rattled against an old vault's rail. 	b
When that grim concave frowned above, 	b
A thoughtful spirit taught me soon, 	b
There if he can to die alone ? ' 	b
When it has worn through many a week 	b
Because thy soul is clear ; 	b
For ever triumphing : 	b
Too truly agonised to weep, 	b
Through wind and ocean's roar, 	b
The face, all deadly fair, 	b
Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire, 	b
AH ! why, because the dazzling sun 	b
But voiceless silence everywhere. 	b
December's sullen time ! 	b
Hope soothes me in the griefs I know ; 	b
Can rob us of the past. 	b
That now I cannot feel ! 	b
That Death he took a certain aim, 	b
The grave is drear, but they are not there : 	b
Away, away, resign thee now 	b
How every drift in their glens profound 	b
Or bless not me with heaven ! * 	b
There is no need of other sound 	b
Of youth's delight, when youth is past, 	b
Day by day some dreary token 	b
But hope is dead for him. 	b
She scarcely feels the flow ; 	b
Faltering, faint, and ready to die. 	b
Begins another voyage nay, they 're gone ; 	b
1 see them foaming high ; 	b
Before their hearts went wandering wrong, 	b
From tracking farther day by day, 	b
Day breathes such beauty over earth and sky, 	b
Raised on my pillow, to descry 	b
And, in the red fire's cheerful glow, 	b
And Lord Eldred glancing round, 	b
And thou false friend and treacherous guide 	b
And never radiant bow could be 	b
Drinks tears, instead of dew ; 	b
A winter sunset in the west 	b
A faithless heart to thee ? 	b
And let Thy holy Spirit shine 	b
Darken that triumphant eye ! 	b
Blood-red, he rose, and, arrow-straight, 	b
Where tears and mourning cannot come. 	b
That wander down to drink the tide. 	b
Enough if storms have bowed his head, 	b
Even Memory's voice grew dim ; 	b
For round their hearths they'll tell this 	b
Yet, loved one, it must be : 	b
More drear I cannot be ! 	b
Those sad relics scattered round ; 	b
The giant sons of Anakim 	b
Sweet, how softly sweet it came 	b
And all around his youthful brow 	b
With alien breezes sadly blent. 	b
All her cherished hopes should wane, 	b
SWART steed of night, thou hast charged thy last 	b
Its face is fair divinely fair ; 	b
It will not, cannot rise ; 	b
But if that night bring only sleep, 	b
Deep in unknown eternity ; 	b
How could I seek the empty world again ? 	b
My eyes are full of tears, 	b
No later light has lightened up my heaven, 	b
Where evening closes dark and chill ; 	b
The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the 	b
Concludes thy musing once again ? 	b
' O DAY ! he cannot die 	b
To breathe its bliss on me ; 	b
Through this false world, their all had 	b
The stream in silence sang once more 	b
And woke her with a sudden song ; 	b
Roderic, for thee shall never rise ! 	b
With my consoling tear? 	b
To the enduring seas 	b
THE ABSENT ONE 	b
O then another daybreak 	b
And grew in another bed ; 	b
1 Oh, for the time when I shall sleep 	b
DREAM, where art thou now ? 	b
Such tears as I weep it is not so ! 	b
And voiceless, soulless, messenger, 	b
O gallant horse, hold on thy course ; 	b
But still they gave no certain token 	b
The captive raised her face ; it was as soft and 	b
To the deadliest press of the gathering fight 	b
Though not because my heart is tame, 	b
' And why should we be glad at all ? 	b
Oh, for the day, when I shall rest, 	b
Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine ; 	b
1 And thou art gone with all thy pride ; 	b
They were clothed in savage attire ; 	b
For the woe I could not bear 	b
Than other love, more true? 	b
Must always fade, and always cloy : 	b
One long look, that sore reproved me 	b
I am thinking of my latest shock, 	b
For now might Faith decay. 	b
Sit beneath the ancient thorn. 	b
And morning's beams will rise as drear. 	b
Their happy souls are gone to God I 	b
Buried in a hapless tomb. 	b
Clouded, even as they would weep. 	b
And, while the wide earth echoing rung 	b
I ne'er had raised this coward cry 	b
To leave our children slaves ! 	b
She heard the river's restless wave 	b
The vast crowds vanished every one ; 	b
And 'mid flowery, smiling plains ; 	b
That we may overflow the sky 	b
I shall smile when wreaths of snow 	b
Till the tufted leaves of the garden bower 	b
But not of wail for men ! 	b
Ah ! no : with louder sound 	b
Gone by as if they 'd never been ; 	b
No ; turn towards the western side. 	b
Or unreal phantoms of distress ! 	b
Her spirit is the unfathomed lake 	b
Adoring virtue's distant star. 	b
ON a sunny brae alone I lay 	b
Wrought up in rain and wailing wind : 	b
Youthful he seemed but worn as they 	b
THE evening sun was sinking down 	b
Exhausted with repinings vain, 	b
The grass-grown grave, did lie, 	b
Daughter divine ! and could his gaze 	b
Where will these bright things be ? 	b
The grand remains of ancient state. 	b
And, all for listening, never sleep. 	b
In all His works displayed. 	b
To greet the general glow. 	b
With a wild and passing thrill, 	b
Are shadowed by her hand at last 	b
grant thy prayer ? 	b
To wander through the snow. 	b
Nor ever let my spirit tire, 	b
And while on that reflected face 	b
And cold suspicion never rise ; 	b
Where thou, and I, and Liberty, 	b
Burned within the avenging flame : 	b
It is but thought full many a night 	b
For them a thousand hopes remain, 	b
The evening comes before the noon, 	b
With heart as summer sunshine light 	b
A wanderer o'er the Atlantic main ; 	b
Till sorrow's source were dry, 	b
Could that sacrifice have purchased 	b
Its green boughs in the breezy sky. 	b
And cheek almost as white as death, 	b
Was it with the fields of green, 	b
Have long forgot their vow ; 	b
The flowers of Fancy, newly-blown : 	b
The starry halls of Elrington 	b
This glorious vision of a grove, 	b
New glories o'er the blighted spring, 	b
Wild the road, and rough and dreary ; 	b
And yet there is or seems at least to be 	b
1 Our guests are darkly lodged,' I whisper'd, gazing 	b
And only wake with you ! 	b
Bowed lowest at thy shrine, 	b
The little glittering spirits sung, 	b
And every vision of old Afric's shore 	b
And my remorse shall die. 	b
And sweeter hope, when hope despairs ! 	b
When the wearied host of the conqueror lies 	b
And the purple violet sweet ; 	b
This day on Elmor Hill ! ! ! ' 	b
While heaven and earth are whispering me, 	b
His own creation's dread despair ! 	b
King Julius lifts his impious eye 	b
Round her returning sight appear 	b
In English fields my limbs were laid, 	b
I dreamt one dark and stormy night 	b
The spirit sent his dazzling gaze 	b
It gathers up thoughts akin to madness, 	b
My heart's blood flows to buy the blessing to 	b
I was at peace, and drank your beams 	b
Might fill with sympathy. 	b
To twilight's shade forlorn ? 	b
What made her weep, what made her glide 	b
A wider sound than mountain wind 	b
Yet still steeped in memory's dyes 	b
Above me, in that stormless sea, 	b
I long to hope that all the woe 	b
In summer's pride imbue 	b
Then I shall rest, while thou wilt weep. 	b
Yet ever in my grateful breast 	b
Where thick the leaves are dancing, 	b
It was thus I said as her graceful head 	b
My mortal flesh you might debar, 	b
They gain the rock's steep wall. 	b
Ye earthly cares begone ! 	b
Or Virtue crouched to Infamy ; 	b
For I Ve been consecrate to grief 	b
Some were dazzling like the sun ; 	b
That struggles in thy breast 	b
A murmuring round the wall. 	b
My downy couch with silk was hung. 	b
And helpless Reason warn in vain ; 	b
Glides through the maze of pleasure wild. 	b
And Peace, the lethargy of Grief ; 	b
And Hope, a phantom of the soul ; 	b
He ever held in his arms. 	b
LADYBIRD ! ladybird ! fly away home, 	b
And trembling yet to hear his name, 	b
While nightly stars are burning, 	b
While evening pours its silent dew, 	b
And will not heaven itself bestow 	b
I trust not to thy phantom bliss, 	b
'My master's voice is low, his aspect bland and 	b
Yet the faint wind comes soothingly 	b
Round walls where only you are vigil keeping? 	b
To-morrow both shall soar away, 	b
Winds sigh as you are sighing, 	b
Entreating, till his eyes o'erflowed, 	b
Gaze on the wretch recall to mind 	b
My spirit should startle their rest and tell, 	b
Since misery was such misery. 	b
To dungeons where a prisoner lies? 	b
PLEAD FOR ME 	b
STILL beside that dreary water 	b
And now the twilight calm and sweet 	b
They stood by mute and pale ; 	b
Restored into the Deity.' 	b
And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
A prayer that would come forth altho' it lingered 	b
And twenty years of tyrant pride 	b
O'er all the crossing thoughts that overflowed. 	b
No, radiant angel, speak and say 	b
And it sprung and flourished ; 	b
Thou bear'st the dim tie of ceaseless dreams, 	b
The earth shone round with a long-lost charm : 	b
For Thine own sake, be Thou its guide, 	b
It had gathered beauty from sunshine and shower, 	b
BETWEEN distress and pleasure 	b
Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays, 	b
The moor-lark in the air, 	b
And saw my offerings on their shrine ; 	b
I thought that Gabriel's self had come 	b
Weighed beneath a mortal sleep ; 	b
So, with a ready heart, I swore 	b
To seek their altar-stone no more ; 	b
His soul has felt the storm below, 	b
Behold him 1 	b
And set my spirit free ? 	b
He must have once been beautiful, 	b
Because we dare not stay to gain 	b
Like vultures round their prey. 	b
A weak and helpless prey ! 	b
How loud the storm sounds round the hall ! 	b
My darling pain that wounds and sears, 	b
Rude the couch that rests us weary ; 	b
Rested from the battle's roar ; 	b
As she would seek repose ; 	b
Mine eye to meet her eye ; 	b
And am I wrong to worship where 	b
wind that blows ; 	b
Of heavy rain or tempest near. 	b
Would part and sunlight shone between, 	b
And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
* THE evening passes fast away, 	b
Lips, that did breathe no murmuring 	b
The wild birds raise their brood ; 	b
What feelings in thy breast?' 	b
One moment, ere I go 	b
Of labour hardly done ; 	b
A thousand thousand silvery lyres 	b
But this world's life has much to dread, 	b
What shadow is it 	b
Bliss like thine is bought by years 	b
'Tis sweet to wander here at night, 	b
I 'M happiest now when most away 	b
One gleam of her heaven-bright face to see. 	b
And Time should Fate condemn ; 	b
Which coming death denied ; 	b
* Then art thou glad to seek repose ? 	b
The bee among the heather bells 	b
AND first an hour of mournful musing, 	b
And earth looks back so dazzling bright 	b
As the dear friend untimely called away ; 	b
And call a lovelier Life from Death, 	b
I breathed not but to send above 	b
That comforts me while thou art here, 	b
Palace and temple crown the glade. 	b
As one who mourns the dead. 	b
Why did the morning dawn to break 	b
And would not pass away ! 	b
Lament their absence drear ; 	b
Over my western beauty's grave, 	b
Patriot fathers' bloody tombs ; 	b
Would rather fight than rest. ' 	b
No ; that tree with branches riven 	b
And sleet and frozen gloom ? 	b
With my dear comrades young and gay, 	b
This very crowd is vacancy ; 	b
I chide with my soul I bid it cherish 	b
From bleak December's sky ? 	b
They deluge my heart like the rain 	b
Within its mossy cell. 	b
How gloomy grows the night ! Tis Gondal's 	b
But God is not like human kind, 	b
Shall meet our dearest, when we die ; 	b
Buried in moors and mountains wild, 	b
Defeat serenely borne, 	b
Which but because more broken gleams 	b
And visions rise, and change, that kill me with 	b
The tiny fountain, churning spray 	b
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall. 	b
Even where he yearns to be I 	b
From the fresh root of Eternity ! 	b
And I may sing and muse aloud, 	b
Their timid forms to guard from harm ; 	b
I love thee, boy, for all divine, 	b
From the dark marble to the sky, 	b
Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom ; 	b
And hush that music's solemn sound, 	b
But, within its parent's kindly bosom, 	b
My love, altho' the very dead 	b
Without the veil between. 	b
Can friendship's flower droop for years 	b
Will forsake thy memory, 	b
All mist and tempest free? 	b
And, behold ! with tenfold increase blessing, 	b
Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray ; 	b
The moonbeams softly shine. 	b
For many a week and many a day 	b
The waveless ocean of repose. 	b
Than Native's heaven can pour. 	b
Down through that ocean's gloomy night ; 	b
Cruel Death ! The young leaves droop and 	b
When flowers were closed and day was o'er 	b
No ! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish 	b
The thrilling shouts of fighting men, 	b
She was cruel in her fear ; 	b
Was only sullen there ! 	b
If our vessels sailed adverse on life's stormy main. 	b
AT CASTLE WOOD 	b
But as in fit of peevish woe, 	b
'Cumber the spirit that would soar 	b
The outward tumult seemed to assuage 	b
Out to the park this dreary day, 	b
She turns from heaven a tearless eye 	b
Even weeping o'er that wretch's woe ; 	b
And mingled with a foreign mould. 	b
One sign of sympathising woe, 	b
A snowy brow in ringlets small, 	b
Till at last, all old links broken, 	b
Vain as thou wert, and weak as vain, 	b
Make answer far and near. 	b
And this is just the joyous hour 	b
Thy soul is powerless over mine.' 	b
She would not, in her tranquil sleep, 	b
She thought when that confession crossed 	b
Do I despise the timid deer, 	b
Chain and bar and dungeon wall 	b
And heaven itself, so pure and blest, 	b
And still entreated him to stay. 	b
And he was once an ardent boy ; 	b
I saw His wisdom and His power 	b
And nothing in the twilight sky 	b
How can I rouse my sinking soul 	b
Say, ' Earth, lie lightly on that breast, 	b
Tortured Gondal's liberty ! 	b
The wind blew from the sea. 	b
But the joy of life was flown 	b
And every window glistens bright 	b
With leaves of frozen dew. 	b
O look again, for still on high 	b
And lights your room like day ; 	b
Bright be thine eyes, undimmed their dazzling 	b
We thought, t When winter comes again. 	b
Ere I would call its glories mine ; 	b
Its root has felt a worm, 	b
Why dost thou repeat again 	b
Till those dark orbs o'erflowing fast 	b
4 Listen ! I Ve known a burning heart, 	b
' Edward, awake, awake 	b
And every time its measured call 	b
A thousand forms, a fearful gloom ; 	b
Or gleams the sun amongst the mists of care? 	b
' When tempests roar on the lonely shore 	b
The aimless, heedless carelessness 	b
His red heart's blood drenched my dagger ; 	b
The music of the Sabbath bell. 	b
The sunshine of a summer's sun 	b
My cold heart, underneath my hand, 	b
Or wakes the breeze in the swaying trees 	b
THE day is done, the winter sun 	b
The heart is dead in infancy, 	b
To hide the streaming tear. 	b
Nor marked how from his own young 	b
To-morrow, Scorn will blight my name, 	b
Thus poured she in that cavern wild 	b
Will load me with a coward's shame 	b
'Twas thus I thought, an hour ago, 	b
And at each belt a weapon dire, 	b
Too heavenly now, but doomed to be, 	b
I cannot find a haven. 	b
When thy heart bounds ardently, 	b
His followers went out with Jubilee, 	b
Their dust is mingled with the sod, 	b
Should cause such bitter woe? 	b
Sad thoughts rose in my mind. 	b
For, who forgives the accursed crime 	b
The violet's eye might shyly flash, 	b
OH, thy bright eyes must answer now, 	b
Thy presence waked a thrilling tone 	b
Where can the weary lay his head, 	b
There have been times when this was drear, 	b
But, traitor, traitor, from that word 	b
All true breasts shrink away ! 	b
The spirit above my couch was bending. 	b
A slave, because I rule thee still ; 	b
As I can hear the ocean's fall 	b
My honour's name to spare ! 	b
And earth seemed such an alien home 	b
* What seek you now on this bleak moor brow, 	b
A sound of music reached my ear : 	b
And there you pass, in happy dreams, 	b
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 	b
Into hopeless, endless mourning. 	b
All those disturbed waves decrease 	b
Stern duty stores for me. 	b
Every leaf speaks bliss to me, 	b
That thou didst visit me? 	b
Though it roar in thunder wild, 	b
Tears have left ghastly traces there, 	b
I AM the only being whose doom 	b
And doubly will the dark world grieve me, 	b
Fast asleep and almost dying, 	b
Are brushing off the scented dew, 	b
Must always end in gloom ; 	b
Midnight moonlight's holy shrine. 	b
It closes with a tomb ! 	b
From thought of grief are free. 	b
Danger, and guilt, and darkness lie, 	b
Weary to watch the spirit languish 	b
Through years of dead despair. 	b
So, if a tear, when thou art dying, 	b
Since I beheld another dwelling. 	b
When I am not, and none beside, 	b
For wild those gusts, and well their chimes 	b
That cold departure pictures mine. 	b
My deadliest pains might die ; 	b
False she was, and unrelenting ; 	b
Seems it not that eve's declining 	b
Of dastard treachery ? 	b
Though comet-like its course was run ; 	b
As wise, to mourn the seed which grew 	b
Upon her dying mind, 	b
Its gentle ray cannot control 	b
It comes at last to cancel time, 	b
Which since this morn laid many low ; 	b
Around me, wretches uttering praise, 	b
Or howling o'er their hopeless days, 	b
It breathed from its heart invisible. 	b
A brotherhood of misery, 	b
That it quenches e'en now the vital spark, 	b
Whose madness daily maddened me, 	b
Arouse thee from thy dreams I 	b
Escape earth's dungeon tomb ? 	b
But only give me back my tears, 	b
What seems the vilest, even like thine 	b
As if to invite the smiling skies ; 	b
Of seraph's song, and demon's moan ; 	b
In concord with her reddening cheek. 	b
As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering un- 	b
And far away in woody dell 	b
I stole away from crowds and light 	b
There like a wild beast turns he back, 	b
Lavished glory on that second May ! 	b
The mortal strife that then befell ; 	b
And yet a little longer speak, 	b
4 Yet moved she not ; she only raised 	b
An earnest grief a strong desire 	b
The city's murmur softly blends 	b
That we must long till life be done ; 	b
As thick as morning's tears ; 	b
That heaven which my sweet lover's brow 	b
His frequent sighs, long-drawn and deep, 	b
And Love I laugh to scorn ; 	b
Could I have seen my country smile ? 	b
A hundred fights for them ! 	b
Little moss-rose, cease to weep, 	b
Their cruel strife may close ; 	b
Will tread its labyrinths alone. 	b
Oh, thy sweet tongue must plead for me 	b
Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 	b
'Tis all that I implore ; 	b
In life and death a chainless soul, 	b
And oh ! above the best of those 	b
If ranks beneath the cannon fall, 	b
I repent not that which my hand has done 	b
And I can sing and I can smile, 	b
Alike, while I have holiday. 	b
Where wilt thou go, my harassed heart 	b
To aid a spirit lost in crime, 	b
What spot, or near or far apart, 	b
Lights me till my life is done ; 	b
There is a spot, 'mid barren hills, 	b
And high its arched windows rise, 	b
The last full cup of triumph drink, 	b
Nor yet the ocean's wave. 	b
Bring good in rising, leave peace in decline, 	b
Sighed at first, but sighed not long ; 	b
Grows as green in April rain, 	b
One glance revealed how little care 	b
The mute bird sitting on the stone, 	b
I was not tired, my darling one, 	b
I saw to-day my enemy. 	b
For ever present to my eye, 	b
My worn heart throbs so wildly 	b
The alien firelight died away ; 	b
And seen in mist and moonlit stone, 	b
I am speaking of a later stroke, 	b
But mine sank sad and low ! 	b
And all do homage to their will, 	b
A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain 	b
And when I laughed they all replied ; 	b
'Till the dread burst breaks forth once more 	b
So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air ; 	b
And as blithely as of yore 	b
When the pen that motto drew. 	b
But long lies the dew on its crimson leaves, 	b
Up rose he, and stretched forth his hand, 	b
And revelled in my changeful dreams, 	b
Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep. 	b
Of each dark night and dim, beclouded day. 	b
I gazed within thine earnest eyes 	b
Brought to earth the fluttering game : 	b
Restraint and heavy task recoil. 	b
The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more 	b
Who spend too soon their youthful day. 	b
The common paths that others run ; 	b
That centre all the joys of years. 	b
That waves in summer air : 	b
Wears not a cloud that speaks of gloom. 	b
To soothe my spirit's care. 	b
From morning's faintest dawning 	b
Begilt with tasselled cords of gold, 	b
Wilt thou prove faithless now ? 	b
I 'd fling the brand in the hissing sea, 	b
So often to the unopened door? 	b
Have sought one gleam of mercy there ! 	b
Across the mountain stream. 	b
A few years of captivity, 	b
And ice upon the glancing stream 	b
You 've tracked me to a lonely spot. 	b
Earth's wilderness was round me spread, 	b
And night obscure his way ; 	b
Mysterious it rose from the billowy moor. 	b
Because they have no stay but thine. 	b
With thunder volleys rolling on before 	b
The sting of anguish drear/ 	b
Re-echo back again. 	b
'Tis better far away ; 	b
They who have been our life, our soul, 	b
Geraldine, wilt thou delay? 	b
For, oh ! when chill the sunbeams fall 	b
My soul, another love. 	b
Following the bend of Aspin's side, 	b
But, if there be a God above, 	b
The whole devoured and lost in death ! 	b
Ere evening far away. 	b
I could think in the withered grass 	b
The loving spirit lingers long, 	b
I turned me from that young saint's bed 	b
Through th' autumnal sky ; 	b
I watch this cloudy evening fall, 	b
For whom his spirit unforgiven 	b
Sweet voices in the halls resound, 	b
Did my exiled spirit grieve. 	b
O no, it was not this ! 	b
'Tis the last line of the woeful song ; 	b
My tortured limbs in dungeons bind, 	b
' It was spring, and the skylark was singing * ; 	b
With a solemn, plaintive sound. 	b
And waken unavailing tears. 	b
Nor absence, nor distance can quell. 	b
And lonely I am pining, 	b
They uttered the music of May ; 	b
Far less when evening's pensive hour 	b
To that deep and swelling river 	b
While thy heart suffers there. 	b
And there were garments spread, 	b
No ten can deal such deadly misery 	b
To walk by the hill-torrent's side ! 	b
It is swelled with the first snowy weather ; 	b
The rocks they are icy and hoar, 	b
Arthur, brother, we returned 	b
Fierce grew Rosina's gloomy gaze ; 	b
There are no yellow stars on the mountain ; 	b
'Tis here 'tis there, 'tis nowhere oh ! my soul, 	b
Gaze not so earnestly upon 	b
Leagues on leagues are left behind 	b
But lovelier than corn-fields all waving 	b
All thy cold and scornful pride, 	b
My spirit drank a mingled tone, 	b
I would have dreary weather, 	b
'Tis thus that human minds will turn, 	b
And envied such despair. 	b
I paused, confounded and distracted, 	b
A lip of cruel scorn ; 	b
To where those signal lights are burning, 	b
And swift were the wings to our feet given, 	b
Their brows are unshadowed, undimmed by woe. 	b
What sudden power the fancy hath 	b
That vision of a mighty host 	b
And this shall be my dream to-night ; 	b
I shall be a dream to thee. 	b
For the moors, where the linnet was trilling 	b
My present entity ! 	b
Within itself may tell ! 	b
And fair it budded day by day 	b
His features in the wave. 	b
Yawned in the city's reeling wall, 	b
On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling, 	b
In my Redeemer's name 	b
And proud its mighty columns show 	b
It feels no sympathy 	b
I hurried down the dark oak stair ; 	b
When I was hardly six years old, 	b
But not the loved music, whose waking 	b
No fear of grief in her bright eyes should quiver ; 	b
In frozen mist arrayed. 	b
Sweet land of light ! Thy children fair 	b
A mutual immortality. 	b
And sprang up to a glorious birth 	b
Needst thou then dissemble sorrow, 	b
Those tears had been heaven to me. 	b
Well well ; the sad minutes are moving, 	b
Though loaded with trouble and pain ; 	b
And some time the loved and the loving 	b
Shall meet on the mountains again I 	b
How could I ask for pitying love, 	b
Thus to the man of sin he spoke : 	b
ward votary, and to recall within his influence the proud mind 	b
And murmur, summer-streams 	b
Some nameless thing which hid not grace, 	b
She strikes it off with little care ; 	b
Shall nature cease to bow ? 	b
From such a lethargy ? 	b
Whose streets stretch round so ceaselessly. 	b
O do not think that God can leave, 	b
Subdued both grief and passion wild. 	b
Loud was the sudden gust of woe 	b
A burdened heart I bear, 	b
' Because, I hoped while they enjoyed, 	b
This shadow should night's welcome be ; 	b
When wounded he wins to the darkest wood, 	b
Sinks from the summer sky, 	b
To watch through all eternity, 	b
And then a captive's tomb. 	b
My ear drank his dying sigh. 	b
But check those coward sobs, and bring 	b
And keep it still divine 	b
Though burning thoughts that spurn control, 	b
That thy dear blood was poured in vain.' 	b
Then art thou not my golden June, 	b
Yet few would ask a heaven 	b
More like this earth than thine. 	b
Then let my winds caress thee ; 	b
But what will winter bring? 	b
Must first be utterly forgot. 	b
And earthly change from pain to pain, 	b
HERE again is the same mind in converse with a like 	b
Rank, beauty, wealth, and power combine 	b
Halos ! O far too bright to shine 	b
The opening sea seemed smooth at last ; 	b
A cloudless moon shone through 	b
* Nay, rather, Gondal's shaken throne 	b
* Douglas, he pleaded bitterly, 	b
I need not sink beneath my woes ; 	b
And yet, through every magic change, 	b
The young and aged tree, 	b
Her forehead, drooped like lily pale. 	b
I needed not its breathing 	b
Her children are rank and her kingdom's spread far. 	b
For him no tear his stern eye shed 	b
How dark the woods will be ! 	b
4 The thick leaves in my murmur 	b
It breaks upon the awful roar 	b
The time of grace is past, 	b
' Well, since it must be told, Lady, 	b
Thy perished faith shall spring to life, 	b
The ringlets of his long black hair 	b
Over the Eden of his soul ; 	b
Love, and its own life, had power to keep it 	b
All round the hot and glaring sky 	b
That dearest boon was given ; 	b
In their own course to flow.' 	b
Evince my gratitude ! 	b
Oh no ; these brighter visions vast 	b
IN MEMORY OF 	b
' 1 '11 win thee 'gainst thy will. 	b
Ere his quivering limbs, all foam-flecked, 	b
They say, ' Zalona celebrates 	b
For Nature's sad reality, 	b
And on its green bank, bathed in gore, 	b
Have slaves subdued the free? 	b
Beneath the church-aisle stone, 	b
And Truth may rudely trample down 	b
And thou for being alone.' 	b
lut dreary, strange, and pale and cold. 	b
It tumbled in an inky sea. 	b
which it is stayed. 	b
' AYE there it is ! it wakes to-night 	b
Deep feelings I thought dead ; 	b
That lulling monotone did sing 	b
To cover deeds untrue, 	b
My lonely years had known. 	b
And by thine eyes' full gaze, 	b
And by the words thou scarce dost speak, 	b
The anguish in my breast, 	b
Besides the mist is half withdrawn, 	b
The moon of summer pours 	b
I weary for that land divine, 	b
O'er each familiar tower. 	b
1 It is hope's spell that glorifies, 	b
That welled from mortal grief, I knew 	b
I HAVE gone backward in the work, 	b
The whisper of its fall : 	b
But those were in the early glow 	b
From thine own influence free ; 	b
That clay he feels will not for ever 	b
Come, leave thy dwelling dark and cold, 	b
1 Thus truly, when that breast is cold, 	b
Thy prisoned soul shall rise ; 	b
The dungeon mingle with the mould 	b
Dire region of most mighty woe, 	b
And is her mirror broke at last 	b
Quietly fed in grassy dells ; 	b
One glimpse of that unearthly form 	b
It treads a forest wide, 	b
The ardent, and the happy breast, 	b
The sullen clouds lay all unbroken 	b
And though its wind repining grieved, 	b
For ever on my heart ! 	b
The holly is dark when the rose-brier blooms, 	b
Hopes quenched, and rising thoughts subdued, 	b
* And hope can hardly deck the cheek 	b
And in the zenith of his fame 	b
And just like his its ringlets bright, 	b
Oppressive mystery hung ; 	b
Though wasted sore with sorrow, 	b
What do these brazen tongues proclaim ? 	b
One task alone remains thy pictured face to view, 	b
THE ELDER'S REBUKE 	b
For nothing nearer paradise 	b
Yes, by the tears I Ve poured, 	b
Kneeling on the blood-stained heath 	b
Watch life's bubbles float away : 	b
To rouse its flickering radiance higher ; 	b
Comes on the increasing roar ! 	b
Oh, in the days of ardent youth 	b
Their dark, their deadly ray would more than 	b
Where that perished sapling used to be ; 	b
Remembrance of his early home 	b
Pondered and approved at last : 	b
Thank the power that banished thee ; 	b
* Glorious is the prize of Duty, 	b
Are quenched in morning dull and grey? 	b
Thy comrades to the camp retire ; 	b
Rests such a shade of deep despair, 	b
Youth's early sunshine was poured on his 	b
She sat without the grated den, 	b
A winter's night. 	b
Heedless feet to gulfs of crime. 	b
For those whose bodies rest in sleep, 	b
That from which it sprung Eternity. 	b
When stealing on to lady's bower, 	b
With looks and smiles divine ! 	b
Far down from heaven its silver flood 	b
That wherever I wander, my heart is with thee. 	b
4 The lays I love so well.' 	b
Virtue is not won by fears.' 	b
Thoughts shut within the silent tomb, 	b
So would I fearful vigil keep, 	b
To send to hell my mortal foe. 	b
Walked by the lightsome touch of pleasure : 	b
Had he ne'er met a gentler teacher, 	b
I saw the burning sunshine fall, 	b
In his most burning mood ; 	b
Heavy and dull as lead. 	b
Might haply dawn above ; 	b
Brenzaida's crest is down ; 	b
To leave its clay a little while, 	b
Can take the bliss that has been given, 	b
True to myself, and true to all, 	b
It was not hope that wrecked at once 	b
That never would cloud the world of day. 	b
The cold corpse from its funeral pall, 	b
A glorious child again ; 	b
And draw his tired gaze from futurity ? 	b
And black the piles of rain-clouds lour 	b
That glory-shedding star shall glow 	b
Where sinless sunshine lay : 	b
So softly evening blends with night, 	b
And seek a rough and lonely way ; 	b
First melted off the hope of youth, 	b
Nor mirth, nor music wakes my halls. 	b
They whispered nought, but, ' Lady, sleep, 	b
When it bears my slumbering child. 	b
Strikes the strings resistlesslyt 	b
The deep-down sea with sudden sound 	b
Calm this resentful mood ; 	b
Darkening all my summer skies, 	b
For well he knew what dangers frowned, 	b
All full of God thy features shine. 	b
The glad birds carolled clear ; 	b
Between his port and him. 	b
My name is on a million tongues, 	b
And nothing but that agony 	b
In daisied lawns sleep peacefully, 	b
And solemn, soothing, softened airs, 	b
* Others have been thou mayst be there. ' 	b
Incline thee to my changeful will, 	b
Thank the power that made thee part 	b
Because I could not save. 	b
It recks not now, when all is over : 	b
The woodland park around it spread, 	b
A mourner still, though friend and lover 	b
And there it lightens ! Dashed with gore 	b
We would not leave our nature home 	b
As if through all the 'wildering maze 	b
Time parts the heart of men. 	b
' Dearest, ever deem me true ' ; 	b
And makes the shout of victory 	b
Remoter still am I from Thee j 	b
And on a strange road journeyed on, 	b
might my eyes with tears run o'er ! 	b
And makes me strong to undergo 	b
But cold cold is that resting-place, 	b
Saw those tokens on the ground. 	b
And dear to me, aye doubly dear, 	b
O'er bower and trees that orb divine 	b
Thy eternal Justice found ! 	b
And sworn friends fall from me : 	b
A memory whose blighting beam 	b
The fate was cruel which bore 	b
To see her cheek's returning glow ; 	b
I saw her stand in the gallery long, 	b
Sleep on ; Heaven laughs above, 	b
A noble victory you shall sing 	b
He almost deemed, might have throbbed again 	b
Part human company ; 	b
And render up life's tiresome load. 	b
That by the death of my dearest treasures 	b
Through the wan autumnal sky ; 	b
I saw his hoof-prints mark the rock, 	b
But this shall be the only time 	b
I can tear my soul from its mould of clay, 	b
Hush its whispers in your breast ; 	b
1 should be where I wish to be. 	b
Crushed helpless into earth and Dust ! 	b
Full many an eye watched over me, 	b
Does sudden silence chill the room ? 	b
My whole heart centred there ; 	b
If you forget the sacred vows 	b
Then let me not despair ; 	b
Such as their lips could only pour, 	b
Beneath whose noble dome 	b
Have anchored safe, and rest at last 	b
His dark, keen eyes on Percy gaze 	b
Gone ! 'tis a word which through life's troubled 	b
Say how long my sleep has been ? 	b
Has warmed and blest me long : 	b
Would bring its after-storm of pain. 	b
Shall set my spirit free, 	b
And nerved, like mine, to kill ; 	b
The elm-tree by the haunted well 	b
THE LADY TO HER GUITAR 	b
And green light slept on the happy earth, 	b
I know our souls are all divine, 	b
To wander far away ; 	b
It is stilled above the slain. 	b
Sighing, mourning ever more. 	b
And his fiery heart aroused panting. 	b
Nor hurt thy soul eternally. 	b
Resounded far and near : 	b
These ceaseless tears ! I wish their flow 	b
This voice, though never heard before, 	b
How little fraught with real ill, 	b
And we together sadly sank 	b
The earth as golden, green, and fair, 	b
What joyous fete begun, 	b
And cheerfully go out to play. 	b
HEAVY hangs the rain-drop 	b
Pours black reproach on^me : 	b
Exhaust thy life and hold thee here. 	b
The reckless man would pray ; 	b
Of his unquenched, unclouded blaze, 	b
* Her heart is beating,' Lesley said, 	b
And heavy throbs the young heart 	b
And then I go to prove if God, at least, be true ! 	b
O'er wood and wold o'er flood and fell, 	b
The choking sob, the tortured moan. 	b
I need not yield to care, 	b
So lost that not a gleam may come. 	b
Frowning on the infant, 	b
Whose windows looked on the minster-yard, 	b
A bleak November's calm. 	b
That melancholy boy. 	b
GODS of the old mythology 	b
The stranger would not turn away, 	b
Long ere the poison-tainted air 	b
Chasing angry thought away. 	b
Where thou dost stand an hour ago, 	b
A deeper cup of bitterer pain ; 	b
On golden summer's forests green, 	b
'Twas grief enough to think mankind 	b
It might not be so drear, 	b
Has never wooed to blow, 	b
Scentless are thy petals, 	b
Can watch the lustre leave its skies 	b
The cannon with unceasing crash 	b
Not one voice sobs * farewell ' ; 	b
Barren is thy beauty, 	b
So heaven's sun shines in thee. 	b
Forget, forsake, refuse to hear ! 	b
You both were vainly given : 	b
I saw the light decay. 	b
YET o'er his face a solemn light 	b
Stanzas 5 and 6 have been crossed out in the manuscript. 	b
From trampling on thy buried breast. 	b
And bounding down the marble stair. 	b
That none can pass again. 	b
His banners all bravely flying ; 	b
And cheered his host by adding stern 	b
Why, Seraph, has thine erring wing 	b
Wafted thee down to weep with him ? 	b
IT *s over now ; I Ve known it all ; 	b
Nor do I come to mingle tears ; 	b
But sweet is day, though with shadows 	b
To feel the frost-wind blow ! 	b
Yet the grass before the door 	b
But never more look up and see 	b
Her darling child from her embrace 	b
Will then like virtues shine ; 	b
* Heavy and dark the night is closing ; 	b
Heavy and dark may its bidding be : 	b
May I never tread the hills again. 	b
Or how in exile misery 	b
' Watch in love by a fevered pillow, 	b
When heaven repels my prayer, 	b
Safe as the petrel on tossing billow, 	b
Like summer's sunshine o'er a hill, 	b
( Guardian-angel he lacks no longer ; 	b
From his last hopeless agony, 	b
Eclipsed the glory of the sky, 	b
And my love is truer than angel-care.' 	b
And all the joyous music breathing by, 	b
The place, the hour the same ; 	b
How canst thou linger now ? 	b
And stars were in the depth of blue, 	b
'Tis true she stands among the crowd, 	b
Even so, Guitar, thy magic tone 	b
The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot 	b
And wept above thy fate the more 	b
Flung streaks of moonshine here and there. 	b
Your eyelids droop, a weight is on your brow ; 	b
Woe to the gifted, crime to the giver, 	b
And singing birds and sighing trees, 	b
And dim the hearts that slowly die. 	b
Spent in her Eden Isle 	b
Passed with the ray whose shine it caught ; 	b
What loves me, no word of mine shall e'er betray, 	b
When, severed wide by guiltless gore, 	b
And all their myriad voices 	b
I heard it then, you heard it too, 	b
He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me ; 	b
Strange Power ! I trust thy might ; trust thou my 	b
Looks from its golden frame ; 	b
And that wide west has waked a word 	b
But listen ! The earth is our campaign of war, 	b
Whose sombre portal hides the light, 	b
Clings Percy's wounded spirit so : 	b
I shall not tread again the deep glens where it 	b
The narrow dungeon of the dead, 	b
A silence settled on the room, 	b
Across the waters of despair 	b
And quench the lamp and stir the fire, 	b
Nor, through long hours of future pain, 	b
Her kind face o'er thee shine ? 	b
Have wrapt the parent orb away. 	b
And give me liberty ! ' 	b
Greets no returning summer skies ; 	b
But yet faint not, mournful man ; 	b
And from that world of heavenly light 	b
To guide us in our lifetime's night, 	b
Drowsy and dark my spirit lies, 	b
But, ere night darkened down 	b
Thou wert so bright and fair, 	b
Yet could I with past pleasures 	b
With blue and ghostly gleams, 	b
Remorse even now may wake within 	b
' Well there is rest there, 	b
For there are angels weeping ; 	b
The streets are crowded all, 	b
Our children felt their fathers' wretchedness ; 	b
Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear ; 	b
And curb my own wild will. 	b
True heart and brow unmarked by time, 	b
The law that bade it not defy. 	b
And called on Heaven to aid 	b
With such a fervent zeal, 	b
The clouded forms of long-past history. 	b
It always walks with head declined, 	b
It vexes me to choose another guide : 	b
Their breasts have burst through the battle's 	b
Their ghostly fingers flecked with snow, 	b
What have those lonely mountains worth reveal- 	b
But a wild bird sprang from his hidden lair, 	b
The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling 	b
Though time should change my youthful face, 	b
THE following are the last lines my sister Emily ever wrote. 	b
No coward soul is mine, 	b
AND like myself lone, wholly lone, 	b
I see Heaven's glories shine, 	b
He hears the stream its waters fling ; 	b
I 'M standing in the forest now, 	b
Almighty, ever-present Deity ! 	b
But a brave heart, with a tarnished name, 	b
The splendour of the main, 	b
They did not dare to smile. 	b
That move men's hearts : unutterably vain ; 	b
With windows yawning on intenser gloom, 	b
When thy stream was troubled, did mine calmly 	b
The wind blew fresh and free. 	b
And forms and faces lost for ever 	b
A thousand dreams of mind. 	b
The steadfast rock of immortality. 	b
Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock, 	b
MILD the mist upon the hill, 	b
Pervades and broods above, 	b
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears. 	b
Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh ; 	b
They kindled the perishing ember 	b
And Thou were left alone, 	b
That love, which will the wicked greet 	b
The oath within that caverned hall, 	b
And from the midst of cheerless gloom, 	b
One calm hour on the brink of life 	b
With thy mind's vision pierce the deep, 	b
Eternal midnight there. 	b
OPPRESSED with sin and woe, 	b
And madness cannot feel thy scorn, 	b
I longed to view that bliss divine 	b
And often when the sun declines 	b
The ghastly night, the ghastlier morrow, 	b
Her wavy hair on her shoulders bare, 	b
The burning tears that would keep welling, 	b
That stains our standard green ? 	b
Living in the depth of Heaven ; 	b
As if each gasp were life expelling, 	b
Like sudden ghosts, to memory came 	b
'Tis nothing to eternity : 	b
Mighty heaven, a glad avenger 	b
Death comes on every wind. 	b
That would not mourn the dead. 	b
Thickening above me evermore. 	b
Has neared its final close, 	b
No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn ; 	b
But mutely trace its airy way, 	b
At last refused to mourn. 	b
And summer days again begin 	b
Changing, and still the same, yet swiftly passing. 	b
The wild wind from that wavy main 	b
I never thought to see again. 	b
Bless thee, bright Sea, and glorious dome, 	b
And thinks he of Patrician pride, 	b
My voice is choked, but not with grief, 	b
Bright, but yet sullied, love which could never 	b
I know my mountain breezes 	b
Deepened the gloom of evening's sky, 	b
And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold 	b
The long grass bending where I lay, 	b
And in the heath or mountain far 	b
The goats fly by with timid cry, 	b
His golden days left long behind. 	b
But then it was a calmer woe, 	b
'Tis many a year, 'tis long ago, 	b
A dream of what had been before j 	b
Was that in which the summer sheen 	b
Ungoverned nature madly spurned 	b
Memory of feelings past, 	b
Often I 've sat down on the ground, 	b
Gazing up to the flush scarce seen, 	b
Those bounding breasts that grief should thrill 	b
Then died away, nor came again ; 	b
Thy deep, unutterable woe? 	b
But my sad heart must ever mourn 	b
It sought thy father's home and mine 	b
As I remembered it of old. 	b
And dreamy scents of fragrance pass 	b
Come back the feelings that would swell, 	b
FAR away is the land of rest 	b
They would have done it had they known 	b
Oh ! I shall weary for the light 	b
I howled, and tore my tangled hair ; 	b
Time has turned the bloom to grey, 	b
Lay in unspeakable despair. 	b
of New York in 1902. 	b
Then 'twas first my nursling smiled ; 	b
But both without a murmur there 	b
But her father smiled on the fairest child 	b
WHAT winter floods, what streams of spring 	b
winds coldly mourn 	b
Dead, dead is my joy, 	b
Might embrace in love again ; 	b
To see that water shine ; 	b
But sighing it murmurs, * Let memory perish, 	b
IN the same place, when nature wore 	b
And nothing on the summer gale 	b
The dearest to a mountaineer 	b
For, if your former words were true, 	b
I cannot say my faith is strong, 	b
Now might we doubt God's guardian 	b
Those wondrous southern Isles to hail, 	b
Behold he sinks away ! 	b
LORD of Elbe, on Elbe hill 	b
The mist is thick and the wind is chill ; 	b
More wakeful heart and eyelids grew. 	b
Has sighed for sorrow that thou wert away. 	b
And in his hair the south wind blows, 	b
And hopeless comes its dark decline, 	b
Oh, we are listening for a sound, 	b
Moans as the night gusts over it blow. 	b
Till each far-down reflection is 	b
I see them far off, and it deepens the gloom ; 	b
An undefined, an awful dream, 	b
Where chill, chill whiteness covered all, 	b
In unexhausted woe. 	b
In darkness long concealed, 	b
Would now be tossing under me. 	b
I will not question, only say 	b
But thou art now on the desolate sea, 	b
Regive him shadowy gleams of infancy 	b
Of love too warm, and wild, and bright. 	b
The Herons are flown to their trees by the Hall ; 	b
COLD, clear, and blue the morning heaven 	b
Will give me to a darker doom ; 	b
Through a sky of cloudy grey. 	b
Reflects that winter sky : 	b
In glimpses of a spirit shore 	b
A silent, silvery star. 	b
And I have long forgot to weep. 	b
Sweetly has its dawn begun ; 	b
But the heaven may shake with thunder 	b
Himself restored to infancy? 	b
To leave my lonely halls ! ' 	b
Bless thee, bless all I cannot speak ; 	b
For the moon now beaming mild above 	b
Go, shed thy tears in Ocean's wave 	b
From that wide heaven where every star 	b
IF grief for grief can touch thee, 	b
One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings 	b
Within their perfumed bower, 	b
Of sorrows gathering near, 	b
From her stately form and her features rare, 	b
And young leaves shoot among the fern. 	b
The twilight fading from the skies, 	b
What ! shall they carve on his tomb with the sword 	b
How thou didst turn in mockery 	b
Sparkling in sunshine and in dew, 	b
Had its waters worn the shore. 	b
Methinks the mellowing haze of years 	b
No doubt had marr'd my word ; 	b
TELL me, tell me, smiling child, 	b
What the past is like to thee? 	b
As glancing o'er the moorland track, 	b
Something in that ancestral pride 	b
Tell me what is the present hour? 	b
A green and flowery spray, 	b
Where a young bird sits gathering its power 	b
Your cold hands hardly hold the weary pen : 	b
And what is the future, happy one? 	b
Sunk to peace the twilight breeze : 	b
A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea, 	b
Stretching into infinity. 	b
The inspiring music's thrilling sound, 	b
No, Earth would wish no other sphere 	b
The glittering splendour rising round, 	b
Yet of the native shepherds none, 	b
So stilly round the evening falls ; 	b
To keep my honour fair ; 	b
Covering her brow to hide the tear 	b
The shepherd placed a seat and pressed 	b
From it the torrents flow ? 	b
Never put back that golden flow 	b
That murmur to the breezes' call 	b
The laden bee flew home, 	b
And raised the covering from his brow, 	b
* Nay, call me not ; it may not be ; 	b
Still spoke to me of years gone by ; 	b
Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending ; 	b
Man's spirit away from the drear dungeon sending, 	b
And sound and sight had well combined 	b
All down the mountain-sides wild forests lending 	b
The mighty voice to the life-giving wind ; 	b
With dying torments riven 	b
Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending, 	b
The withering corpse to me. 	b
The busy day has glided by, 	b
For not through age, and not through crime, 	b
Of the golden-gifted time ; 	b
And, Douglas ! thou shalt be 	b
When my sad soul forgot its pride 	b
Since cast from off thine angel brow 	b
Woods, you need not frown on me ; 	b
I have suffered on thro' night and day ; 	b
To know where she is laid. 	b
You need not mock so bitterly. 	b
Thy silvery form, so soft and fair, 	b
I watched how evening took the place 	b
And, far away, down Elmor scars 	b
* The birds that now so blithely sing, 	b
And warms the breezy air. 	b
The waste of youth, the waste of years, 	b
COME walk with me, 	b
And still the words and still the tone 	b
I dream of moor, and misty hill, 	b
In all the hours of gloom 	b
Will find a heart to bear. 	b
WELL narrower draw the circle round, 	b
Laid low in dust their Dryad-hair. 	b
Through the long nights of angry weather, 	b
When parted ghosts might come, 	b
Above their prisoned dust to grieve 	b
Its twilight hours and evenings dark 	b
Whose waves are foaming far and wide. 	b
One gush of ardent prayer. 	b
Forget the hopes of years : 	b
With the radiant red of furnace flames 	b
Senselessly has lain. 	b
To the discord of lute-strings all unstrung. 	b
My robes, and smooth my tangled hair ; 	b
And constant sorrow on my brow 	b
The saints shall shelter thee from harm. 	b
And spread with smiles the evening meal ; 	b
In years by time long left behind ; 	b
TO A WREATH OF SNOW 	b
When I began to pray. 	b
And still it bent above, 	b
They come sailing on, 	b
How oft have I forgot my God, 	b
Yet my heart loves December's smile 	b
That tracks the boundless blue. 	b
Paints her image on the mind. 	b
Of gazing in thine eyes. 	b
And think the fearful vision o'er. 	b
The blossoms to deck my home with the dead. 	b
Tis like the heaven which parting days 	b
The idol chiefs of all. 	b
As if grown weary of the light 	b
When its lips opened and a sound 	b
Awoke the stillness reigning round, 	b
Faint as a dream, but the earth shrank, 	b
And truly like a god she seems, 	b
Woe for the day ! Regina's pride, 	b
Retracing back her lifetime flown ; 	b
And thus in strange response he spoke. 	b
The circling hills to kiss. 	b
Where fairer forms in darkness lie ; 	b
That time is treasuring up for me. 	b
Sound through the granite glen ; 	b
All vague and undefined ? 	b
That sad lament was ringing ; 	b
Twill break for thee. 	b
Such dreamy, dreary singing. 	b
Aware her last hour approaching fast, 	b
Of mirror broken on the grass, 	b
Watch for a bird with sable wing, 	b
And weaker minds would fear. 	b
I listened to thy mournful sighing. 	b
Were by a faint breeze blown ; 	b
I knew the source whence sprung those tears 	b
They raise their eyes, for the sunny skies 	b
Reveal ; where o'er a lone green wood 	b
How well my spirit knows the path 	b
Was given me in that silent hour 	b
In a yeoman's home-close grew ; 	b
In cell and cloister drear ; 	b
At last the sunshine left the ground, 	b
The bright blue flowers and velvet sod, 	b
Were strange conductors to the bowers 	b
I need not fear my foes, 	b
Aid for that which lies before. 	b
In a grave that never shuts its dead 	b
Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface 	b
In cloudy morning clothed the sky. 	b
Come, sit down on this sunny stone ; 	b
I saw His wisdom infinite, 	b
In her uncovered eye ; 	b
But beneath the earth is midnight 	b
Waiting to hear the lingering feet 	b
And whistles round the gloomy wall, 	b
And lingering long, and thinking grieves, 	b
How it longed how it burned to be free ! 	b
And no one laughed, and none seemed free from 	b
He wakens, and how ghastly white 	b
By whom all things were made ; 	b
So, resting on a heathy bank, 	b
And will sustain when thou art gone. 	b
me mourn ; 	b
An anguish in his bosom now ; 	b
COMPANIONS all day long we 've stood 	b
Fixed strainedly on the vacant air ; 	b
His wisdom so divine, 	b
Weak, wretched sinner though I be, 	b
Sleeping silently and still, 	b
On Eversham's woody brow. 	b
That living, is not nobler now 	b
Too full to hide their tears, too stern to overflow ; 	b
To see the sunshine disappear ; 	b
The breeze sings like a summer breeze 	b
Then silent weep J cannot weep, 	b
Cut off from hope in early day, 	b
From earth and glory cut away. 	b
That haunts his feudal home ; 	b
Must image forth the scowl of night, 	b
And childhood's flower must waste its bloom 	b
Beneath the shadow of the tomb. 	b
Though vengeance held a sheathed sword 	b
And still did evening fall ; 	b
Through infinite immensity. 	b
Wave gently round her head. 	b
Tells what once those features were, 	b
By that celestial shine I 	b
And the dying their last watch were keeping 	b
Let us be laid in lasting rest, 	b
Lost their robes of tender green ? 	b
That I should greet approaching feet, 	b
Half the sweet, the haunting smile ; 	b
Other desires and other hopes beset me, 	b
There is a voice in the wind that waves 	b
And pleasure tune its chords again. 	b
And my eyes cannot hold the tears 	b
Was it some feeling of delight, 	b
From the time of morning's earliest dew 	b
Blasts with that oath his perjured soul, 	b
Kindle a short and bitter smile, 	b
The sun of evening died, 	b
Sleep, stilly sleep, thou bright-haired child, 	b
Its large dark eyes of shadowy light, 	b
Waveless and calm lies that silent deep 	b
They fleck with shade our mountains bright 	b
A little longer in this reverie : 	b
Upon its heathy shores. 	b
But not a dream of sleep ; 	b
Ah ! could my hand unlock its chain, 	b
Were off like light again. 	b
For every torturing tear. 	b
And chained was every tongue. 	b
To mourn o'er what I mourn. 	b
God ! bless her sun with victory, 	b
In some warm nook a couch to find. 	b
strong and far : 	b
Fluttering from the autumn tree. 	b
That through the shadows shone 	b
The languid lid would close, 	b
Though I no more may watchful bend 	b
Through dreams where startling imagery 	b
Can no memory now recall 	b
Home to their journey's end ; 	b
ALONE I sat ; the summer day 	b
Had died in smiling light away ; 	b
Returning to my breast again. 	b
For past misery are we weeping? 	b
I will sail the desert sea. 	b
Roams in the dawn of day ; 	b
The harvest-moon looks down ; 	b
Look on those woods, look on that mountain lorn, 	b
I '11 hide it in my heart no more, 	b
Then why is all so sad and lone? 	b
How invincible its roar, 	b
A shattered wreck on ocean's tide, 	b
But that at Ambition's bidding, 	b
The heart so long endeared to thee, 	b
Are you a hawk to follow the prey, 	b
Till death shall sound his signal cry, 	b
Visions by ardent fancy fed 	b
And yet a dreamlike comfort came 	b
But now, when I had hoped to sing, 	b
My fingers strike a tuneless string ; 	b
Who bound us in one vigorous whole 	b
Still clung she to his bridle rein 	b
Yet have I read these falcon eyes, 	b
He faintly prayed, < O Death, delay 	b
But a tyrant spell has bound me, 	b
'Tis like old age pretending 	b
Roofless, crumbling to the ground ; 	b
Their bare boughs weighed with snow, 	b
We both together struck the blow ; 	b
And yet I cannot go. 	b
OH, all the cares these noontide airs 	b
Wastes beyond wastes below ; 	b
When the sun first crowned the hill, 	b
Beneath these sullen skies? 	b
I 'LL come when thou art saddest, 	b
Bring light to the darkened room, 	b
When the rude day's mirth has vanished, 	b
Spirit of bliss ! what brings thee here, 	b
Long he gazed and held his breath, 	b
I '11 come when the heart's worst feeling 	b
Has entire, unbiassed sway, 	b
But some I read so well, 	b
And gives to fancy magic power 	b
It was a summer day that saw 	b
Listen ! 'tis just the hour, 	b
But who reads not through the tender glow 	b
But thank your passion not for me ! 	b
A flood of strange sensations roll, 	b
Forerunners of a sterner power, 	b
Heralds of me? 	b
THE soft unclouded blue of air, 	b
Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke 	b
How daredst thou wake thoughts in me, 	b
And lived upon this weary Earth 	b
But then I knew that he stood free, 	b
Was it the smile of early spring 	b
And then I felt . . . \unfinished\. 	b
Now trust a heart that trusts in you, 	b
Douglas leaned above the well ; 	b
And may not be forgiven. 	b
My heart is with your heart at home ; 	b
cold, cold is my heart ! 	b
We both were scorned, both sternly driven 	b
Over his own unhappy soul ; 	b
Unless I change in every thought, 	b
And memory will restore me nought, 	b
Look now she rests below, 	b
The clouds are earthward yearning ; 	b
The smothering snow-clouds rolled away ; 	b
The barren mountain-side lies bare, 	b
He would not give one moorland wild 	b
As shines earth's sun in summer noon 	b
And whiter brows than yours may be, 	b
Where city walls spread wide around 	b
And lightning looks from orbs divine 	b
About my pathway burn and shine. 	b
But that pure light, changeless and strong, 	b
That last dim beam that sets for thee, 	b
Echoing to their bells. 	b
My feeble faith still clings to Thee. 	b
When we were wont to burst away 	b
Remembrance never dies, 	b
From hope, and peace, and power, and 	b
Her former life's eventful day 	b
Know nought akin to our despair ; 	b
Without a voice to speak to you 	b
For that mist may break when the sun is high, 	b
For bygone griefs and dried-up tears. 	b
In open day and cheerful sun, 	b
Lord Lesley, let it free ; 	b
Waiting the death that was to come. 	b
On which it ought to wend. 	b
Sleep brings no strength to me, 	b
Must claim from Justice lasting rest ; 	b
Youth's warm affections gave, 	b
To meet its early tomb ? 	b
Mad though that anguish be, 	b
As warm as middle June. 	b
And yet it seems a dreary moor, 	b
Was heavier far than earth can be ; 	b
A shelter from the sky. 	b
And never Fejian devotee 	b
My only wish is to forget 	b
In endless sleep of death. 	b
Fireless hearths, and lifeless homes ; 	b
Had they but seen their idol then, 	b
Strong I stand, and laugh to see 	b
That leaf from its parent tree ; 	b
Shut out from joy and liberty, 	b
All the puny ways of men ; 	b
The first to fight, the last to fall, 	b
Then come again ; thou wilt not shrink 	b
The glory of the festal day, 	b
Ought for a moment to be mine : 	b
Affrightened from that ceaseless roar. 	b
Beneath its mighty glare : 	b
Thing of Dust, with boundless pride, 	b
Dare you ask me for a guide ? 	b
Will hardly let her gleam, 	b
Or any, but an exile's doom. 	b
Windows through whose broken panes the night- 	b
To free the world from tyrant's chain, 	b
For which we fought and bled and died. 	b
I saw her give th' unanswered kiss 	b
Full soon divided him from me. 	b
Where their bright glories shone at first. 	b
To shelter 'neath a foreign heaven ; 	b
Till far beyond earth's frenzied strife, 	b
That should startle the nations that rest around. 	b
What pleasant airs upon her face 	b
Confused and strange and drear. 	b
She sits and fondly seems to trace 	b
And never more at early dawning 	b
And I must see the final gloom 	b
The accursed man shall be ; 	b
Dear childhood's innocence forgive, 	b
And my eye can wander through worlds of light. 	b
Methinks their chime sounds faint and drear, 	b
My lids closed down, yet through their veil 	b
The glory of a summer sky. 	b
And form my mood to Nature's mood. 	b
The tiny ripples flame. 	b
Went, and ne'er returned again ! 	b
I cannot bear to go away. 	b
May beam the blaze of July's sun, 	b
To soothe your grief or calm your care ; 	b
Nay, do not weep ; that bitter mourning 	b
And man's remarks or sighs or scorn, 	b
Full many a heart, that in the tomb, 	b
For ever dark, for ever cold. 	b
You '11 dry your tears and check your sighing, 	b
Lie low and lone the silent dead ; 	b
FALL, leaves, fall ; die, flowers, away ; 	b
If I were quite alone, 	b
One ripple in the lovely lake ; 	b
Lost, cursed, degraded all for thee ! 	b
There are bones whitening there in the 	b
Fernando left his home and you, 	b
And still I think you must remember 	b
Marking my despondency. 	b
Lit by the evening flame, 	b
I longed to see his face again, 	b
From his daylong dream at once he woke ; 	b
Better that I my own fate mourning, 	b
Except for you, my dearest queen ! 	b
There lies a lone and lovely glade, 	b
And there the hearts together nourished, 	b
Since parted from thee I am left alone, 	b
The afternoon in softened glory 	b
In the old church beneath the stone, 	b
And the broad park spread before me 	b
And curse instead of pray. 	b
And there I stood when he had left me, 	b
With ashy cheek and tearless eye, 	b
Watching the ship whose sail bereft me 	b
In gathering gloom in every glade, 	b
By the wild storm blasts roughly broke, 	b
O may I never lose the peace 	b
My soul still bounded o'er the billow, 	b
The curtains waved, the wakened flies 	b
The azure flowers where they were nursed, 	b
One brief glimpse to thine eye, I 	b
Its much-desired repose. 	b
Of safe deliverance from the sea. 	b
Yet, alas ! the sooner turning 	b
And drowned my bloom of youth in tears. 	b
And time at length brought power for coping 	b
With thoughts I could not once endure. 	b
MAY flowers are opening, 	b
The place that saw our last farewell, 	b
Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe, 	b
In plundered churches piled with dead 	b
Go out upon the breezy moor ; 	b
AWAKE, awake ! how loud the stormy morning 	b
Calls up to life the nation's resting round ; 	b
What follows in Ula's garden sweet 	b
And violet and wild woodrose 	b
One whisper, one sweet dream in him, 	b
' Twill only yield another sight 	b
That while the world was lost to her 	b
A beam of glory there, 	b
It was cultured by another hand, 	b
A traitor's perjury. 	b
And her look of Majesty. 	b
The sea-green standard lies in dust beneath. 	b
To which my own was given ; 	b
Soldiers, preserve that glory bright and free ; 	b
It was just the time of eve, 	b
Let me remember half the woes 	b
Are but the shattered glass 	b
Can still the spirit's storm ; 	b
While thou canst speak with such a tone ! 	b
But how can I live lonely here? 	b
From turret, tower and wall. 	b
And prone to every sin ; 	b
And in the haze of glorious light 	b
I have sat lonely all the day, 	b
In the pure light of childhood's morn, 	b
Where blackbird and the throstle dwell ; 	b
Save that deep gong which tolled my 	b
A thousand strains of Music swell. 	b
For God alone doth know how blessed 	b
And every listener swears it true ; 	b
And tell me, why such blessed sleep 	b
Unlike the bloom I like to see. 	b
So full of soul, so deeply sweet ; 	b
The grave must close those limbs around, 	b
The moonbeam and the storm, 	b
While the wind is whispering only, 	b
Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim. 	b
How can I break these iron chains, 	b
Are the hours to come, the joyless hours, 	b
With beams of such impartial blaze, 	b
It chained the snow-swollen streams no more. 	b
And they will reach it soon. 	b
And then a sudden flash of flame, 	b
And leave my human feelings 	b
Into my heart and anxious eye, 	b
Then his eyes began to weary, 	b
Amid the howling storm of war? 	b
care and tears and pain. 	b
But coldly breaks November's day ; 	b
But hate eternally. 1 	b
Eldenna's waves are rolling red, 	b
Shade of history, I condemn 	b
If my spirit's eye can see, 	b
And deeper green is on the hill. 	b
I looked out to see her there, 	b
They all are held in me ; 	b
And all seem glad their voice to hear ; 	b
Wisdom, scorned, knows no relenting ; 	b
A tear might flow, ay, many a tear, 	b
And there in those wild bowers 	b
No whisper, not to me ; 	b
I could not sleep through that wild siege, 	b
I know that I have done thee wrong, 	b
And mourned a love for ever flown. 	b
Sank back again to childhood's day ; 	b
Its cheering smile to see, 	b
That sin was purified by woe. 	b
Your worlds of solemn light, again, 	b
To us, in unimagined bloom, 	b
And she springs up in haste to greet 	b
And thou art near thy prime? 	b
It was a pleasant April day 	b
So I knew that he was dying 	b
Watching the drizzly mist descend, 	b
Descend like rain upon the heath. 	b
Its deadly mist o'er joys and cares. 	b
Held by the mountain men. 	b
Like bandit-knife was hung. 	b
And what shall change that angel brow, 	b
To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region ; 	b
Laid on the grass I lapsed away, 	b
Blend with a song of troubled times. 	b
To seize the falling rein. 	b
Thus thy first hour's course shall be : 	b
With voice subdued and steady look, 	b
Spring grass grows green and fair ; 	b
Call Death yes Death he is mine own, 	b
To live in every sweetest thought ; 	b
And sweeter than a flute's reply 	b
Where royal corpses lay. 	b
And there was eastern incense burnt, 	b
For sun, before they close, 	b
In mercy launch one arrow more ; 	b
With sacred halos round it shed ? 	b
But death has stolen our company, 	b
And words upon the breezes hung. 	b
Its sufferings and its tears. 	b
' Bless it ! My gracious God ! ' I cried. 	b
Welcome at last, though once so drear. 	b
Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish 	b
Shall our feet forget the way ? 	b
Vainly would man divine or tell. 	b
STRONG I stand, though I have borne 	b
Look how in sable gloom 	b
A darker wave. 	b
Glows o'er the graves of Elrington, 	b
It was about the middle night 	b
So their fond hearts were free, 	b
The shallow wrecks of memories 	b
Looks down on the descending sun ; 	b
Thou art my intimate delight, 	b
Deep secrets of His Providence 	b
It pines in cold captivity, 	b
One penance tender tears. 	b
HINDER me by no delay ! 	b
He dared not say me nay the hinges harshly turn. 	b
Yonder they stand and watch the waves 	b
What have I now? The star that brightly 	b
Dry thine eyes, too ; 'tis vain to keep 	b
HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES 	b
Now seems as nothing in the single cloud 	b
That laid my best affections low, 	b
That thou wouldst call to mind. 	b
And yet, a king, though Prudence well 	b
My horse had strayed, I cannot say ; 	b
Zamorna is this nobly done, 	b
But could the day seem dark to me 	b
Those tones were softer than the moan 	b
Has passed from summer's heaven divine, 	b
I ask for nothing further here 	b
From the side of the wintry brae. 	b
I should not be if that were gone 	b
YES, holy be thy resting-place 	b
THROUGH the hours of yesternight 	b
She murmured with a sigh. 	b
And nations round are fearing, 	b
So humbly by her side ; 	b
That set on fire my heart, but froze upon my 	b
An icy glory caught mine eye, 	b
O come away ! The Norman door 	b
And my glad heart bound wilder still. 	b
From his heart's fountain swell, 	b
My hour of rest had fleeted by, 	b
Toss up the window's velvet veil, 	b
What is past can hurt no more ; 	b
To sit within this Norman door, 	b
No : that I feel can never be ; 	b
* Angora's hills have heard their tread, 	b
* Well, thou hast fought for many a year, 	b
Like youth, to my maturer eyes, 	b
She sees us, sister, now ; 	b
And I have sat and watched the trees, 	b
Their glory-haloed crown to wear. 	b
And merry words to whispers die, 	b
Whose forms have troubled me, 	b
The woods and fields and golden flowers 	b
That we must bind thee down and clench thy 	b
Is welcome as a friend ; 	b
Though earth and man were gone, 	b
False and foolish mortal know, 	b
I 've trod a dark and frightful way. 	b
As kindly as the good. 	b
The pure blue heaven with clouds of gold ; 	b
Though not for fear, though not for shame. 	b
Which shapeless figures on each piece 	b
Those eyes shall make my only day, 	b
As long as thou, the solemn night, 	b
My outward sense is gone, my inward essence 	b
And the crags where I wandered of old. 	b
Joins the mad world in all its scorn. 	b
Bore his soul from earth away. 	b
Then why lament that those we love 	b
And wild birds bursting from their songless nest, 	b
But yet it was a glorious sun, 	b
When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes 	b
What my soul bore, my soul alone 	b
Have studied long their glance and feel 	b
And all my prospect of relief 	b
His heart is stirred through all its strings, 	b
And then a wakening from above ; 	b
As it tossed against the heaven, 	b
