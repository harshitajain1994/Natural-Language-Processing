This code that will determine whether a poem is a limerick or not. To do this, we will be using the CMU pronunciation dictionary 


• num syllables: count the number of syllables in a word 
• rhymes: detect whether two words rhyme or not 
• is limerick: given a candidate limerick, return whether it meets the constraint or not. 


a new function called apostrophe tokenize that handles apos- trophes in words correctly so that “can’t” would rhyme with “pant” if the is limerick function used apostrophe tokenize instead of word tokenize.
